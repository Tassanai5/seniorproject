go make yourself some friends or youll be lonely
once i was seven years old
it was a big big world but we thought we were bigger
pushing each other to the limits we were learnin quicker
by eleven smokin herb and drinkin burnin liquor
never rich so we were out to make that steady figure
once i was eleven years old my daddy told me
go get yourself a wife or youll be lonely
once i was eleven years old
i always had that dream like my daddy before me
so i started writin songs i started writin stories
something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
cause only those i really love will ever really know me
once i was twenty years old my story got told
before the mornin sun when life was lonely
once i was twenty years old lukas graham
i only see my goals i dont believe in failure
cause i know the smallest voices they can make it major
i got my boys with me at least those in favor
and if we dont meet before i leave i hope ill see you later
once i was twenty years old my story got told
i was writin bout everything i saw before me
once i was twenty years old
soon well be thirty years old our songs have been sold
weve traveled around the world and were still roamin
soon well be thirty years old
im still learnin about life my woman brought children for me
so i can sing them all my songs and i can tell them stories
most of my boys are with me some are still out seekin glory
and some i had to leave behind my brother im still sorry
soon ill be sixty years old my daddy got sixtyone
remember life and then your life becomes a better one
i made a man so happy when i wrote a letter once
i hope my children come and visit once or twice a month
soon ill be sixty years old will i think the world is cold
or will i have a lot of children who can warm me
soon ill be sixty years old
soon ill be sixty years old will i think the world is cold

a bunch of stereotypes all in my head
i remember doing the math like yeah im good at little league
a preconceived idea of what it all meant
for those that like the same sex had the characteristics
the rightwing conservatives think its a decision
and you can be cured with some treatment and religion
manmade rewiring of a predisposition
playing god aw nah here we go
america the brave still fears what we dont know
and god loves all his children is somehow forgotten

if i was gay i would think hiphop hates me
have you read the youtube comments lately
man thats gay gets dropped on the daily
weve become so numb to what were sayin
our culture founded from oppression
yet we dont have acceptance for em
call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board
a word rooted in hate yet our genre still ignores it
and gay is synonymous with the lesser
its the same hate thats caused wars from religion
gender to skin color the complexion of your pigment
the same fight that led people to walkouts and sitins
its human rights for everybody there is no difference
live on and be yourself
when i was at church they taught me something else
if you preach hate at the service those words arent anointed
that holy water that you soak in has been poisoned
when everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless
rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen
i might not be the same but thats not important
no freedom til were equal damn right i support it
and i cant change
even if i tried
even if i wanted to
my love my love my love
she keeps me warm
she keeps me warm
she keeps me warm
she keeps me warm
we press play dont press pause progress march on
with a veil over our eyes we turn our back on the cause
til the day that my uncles can be united by law
when kids are walking round the hallway
plagued by a pain in their heart
a world so hateful some would rather die than be who they are
and a certificate on paper isnt gonna solve it all
but its a damn good place to start
no laws gonna change us we have to change us
whatever god you believe in we come from the same one
strip away the fear underneath its all the same love
about time that we raised up sing

and the flames are burnin quick as fire would through this building
youre sealed in but youre fireproof flame retardant you withstood it
and as you climb up to the roof youre just chillin you look down cause youre so over em
you could put the heel of your foot through the ceiling
as time passes things change every day
but wounds wounds heal but scars still remaining the same
but tomorrow todays going down in flames
throw the match set the past ablaze
so feel the fire beneath your feet as you barely even
perspire from the heat exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
and as you say goodbye to the grief its like watching the walls melt
in your prison cell but youve extinguished this livin hell
still a little piece of you dies as you scream
im standin in the flames
and its a beautiful kind of pain
settin fire to yesterday
to find the light find the light find the light
standin in the flames
and its a beautiful kind of pain
settin fire to yesterday
find the light find the light find the light
i feel the burn
watch the smoke as i turn rising
a phoenix from the flames
i have learned
from fighting fights that werent mine
its not with fists
but with wings that i will fly
and im standin in the flames
and its a beautiful kind of pain
settin fire to yesterday
to find the light find the light find the light
standin in the flames
and its a beautiful kind of pain
settin fire to yesterday

and wakes just in time to greet the new year
remembers the kisses remembers the laughter
and all thats gone away
she shuffles around turning the lights on
goes to the kitchen gets the champagne
opens the window and wrapped in a blanket
begins to count and wait
ten nine eight seven six five
four three two one
happy new year happy new year
they say you can hear it over the island
starting in times square and spreading throughout
a roar like the ocean it comes from a distance
grows louder then turns quiet
she sits in a dream or in a memory
while old conversations play in her ears
sometimes the minutes feel longer than hours
some days feel long as years
shes just glad she gets to be around
to see another spring come to this town
happy new year happy new year
to you
she sets her alarm five minutes to midnight
and wakes just in time to say her goodbyes
thanking the old year for all it has brought her
no mention of the things it took away
she shuffles around turning the lights out
closes the window checks on the locks
folds up the blanket empties the bottle
and leaves it in the hallway dark
shes just glad she gets to be around
to see another spring come to this town

are the worst of all and the bloods run stale
i wanna hide the truth i wanna shelter you
but with the beast inside theres nowhere we can hide
no matter what we breed we still are made of greed
this is my kingdom come this is my kingdom come
when you feel my heat look into my eyes
its where my demons hide its where my demons hide
dont get too close its dark inside
its where my demons hide its where my demons hide
at the curtains call its the last of all
when the lights fade out all the sinners crawl
so they dug your grave and the masquerade
will come calling out at the mess youve made
dont wanna let you down but i am hellbound
though this is all for you dont wanna hide the truth
no matter what we breed we still are made of greed
this is my kingdom come this is my kingdom come
when you feel my heat look into my eyes
its where my demons hide its where my demons hide
dont get too close its dark inside
its where my demons hide its where my demons hide
they say its what you make i say its up to fate
its woven in my soul i need to let you go
your eyes they shine so bright i wanna save that light
i cant escape this now unless you show me how
when you feel my heat look into my eyes
its where my demons hide its where my demons hide
dont get too close its dark inside

from the porch of your victorian apartment
we sat outside
the air was broken and summer was barging in
the homeless lady pushed her shopping carts
and your neighbors played mariachi music until 4 am
you said when this one passes i should probably walk away
because im gonna leave you the first chance i get
im a black hole im empty and dead
you can carve your name in stone
but its just not permanent
but you told me you think you loved me
when you collapsed on the floor of your room
after you told me to leave
in that moment
i realized i was sure i loved you too
so now im always putting out fires with my bare hands
until two black stumps are all that remain
i dont think my feeble hearts enough
to blanket these growing flames
you can drop me at the hospital
ill od on morphine and dream about you
as my heart seizes one more time before you go
then ill probably wake up alone and be alone forever
with an itch on my back that i cannot scratch
in the shape of your heart
forever
everybody leaves
everybody leaves eventually
everybody breaks
bends to late
nobodys happy
youll never be happy this time
when its your heart on the line
take a step back  who would really want to fall in love
now it all plays out and the way you call me babe
dies with every other nickname
i have so many nicknames i cant keep track anymore
ill bury them in bourbon and halfsmoked cigarettes
as we come to an end
or to an understanding i dont want to understand
because everybody leaves
everybody leaves eventually
everybody breaks
bends too late
and no one is happy
youll never be happy this time

then theyll never let you see another day

ill miss the way that everything could find a way to break me down

i see what youre talkin bout no way to soften that
cause me i was tryna find out where i lost em at
but maybe i aint lose em at all
maybe i keep movin forward and theyre just stagnant they aint movin at all
but when they need a favor who do they call
maybe im searchin for the problems askin what was said and who was involved
too focused on peoples feedback and provin em wrong
they say the shoe can always fit no matter whose foot its on
these days feel like im squeezin in em
whoever wore em before just wasnt thinkin big enough im bout to leave em with em
cause if i run the game in these man the seams are splittin
no pun intended but they smellin defeat in the air
headed where nobody took it who meetin me there
they tell him that he talkin crazy but he doesnt care

and theres nothing i can do
while i read the latest from the breaking
story on the news
and people swear they say its fake
and look up to our leader
as he speaks from a mind so bleak
he preys on his believers
everyones bitter pointing their fingers
seeing the worst in each other
but people are not their skin or their god
or who they claim their lover
i think that people are made so unequal
some are born good and some evil
and so here i pray for one single day
that we can live here peaceful
the world is falling down
and nothing ever changes
one two three as the shots ring out
but nothing ever changes
the world is falling down
and nothing ever changes
were all part of a silent crowd
cause nothing ever changes
twelve more killed at a local bar
some were only twentyone
but the nra has bills to pay
and feeds us with more guns
so we send our thoughts and prayers
to those who lost their lives
but the cycle stays and in a couple of days
bullets fly and a few more die
im not a scholar im not an expert
but if you fight fire with fire
im pretty sure it only gets worse
the flames burn even brighter
i know that im not alone
when i say im sick of the violence
voice our anger on our phones
but in real life were quiet shhh
the world is falling down
and nothing ever changes
one two three as the shots ring out
but nothing ever changes
the world is falling down
and nothing ever changes
were all part of a silent crowd
cause nothing ever changes
i hope that when i fast forward
twentysomething years
we no longer live our days
in hatred or in fear
and live to be kind and free
to do unto each other
as youd have em do unto you
united undercover

your life delayed your days are slow
twisting over bright lights overhead

just in the very pose

when she went to the middle of the ballroom to sing

he is your friend
he once told me that i should turn to you
pierre sniffed as he looked at her but he didnt speak
til then he had reproached her and tried to despise her
but now he felt such pity for her
that there was no room in his soul for reproach
he is here now
tell him totell him to forgive me
yes i will tell him to forgive you
but he gave me your letters
no i know that all is over
i know that it never can be
but still im tormented by the wrongs ive done him
tell him that i beg him to forgive forgive
forgive me for everything
yes i will tell him tell him everything
but
but i should like to know one thing
did you love
did you love that bad man
dont call him bad
but i dont know i dont know at all

and a greater sense of pity tenderness and love overflowed pierres heart
he felt the tears begin to trickle underneath his spectacles
and he hoped that no one would see
we wont speak of it anymore
we wont speak of it my dear
but one thing i beg of you consider me your friend
and if you ever need help or simply to open your heart to someone
not now but when your mind is clear
think of me

dont speak to me like that
i am not worth it
stop stop stop
you have your whole life before you
before me no all is over for me
all over
music stops
if i were not myself
but the brightest handsomest
best man on earth
and if i were free
i would get down on my knees this minute
and ask you for your hand
and for your love
music resumes
and for the first time in many days
i weep tears of gratitude
tears of tenderness
tears of thanks
and glancing at pierre
oh pierre
i leave the room smiling
and restraining tears of tenderness
tears of joy which choke me
i throw my fur coat on my shoulders
unable to find the sleeves
outside my great broad chest
breathes in deep the air with joy
despite the ten degrees of frost

i gather up my thoughts and questions
could i ever be like you
could i ever be a person so real and so true
it seems implausible
i look at my reflection
if only i could say
the things i never mention
the things you never knew
and id like to thank you for the human ive become
im sorry if ive let you down
im trying im learning as i stumble along
to see this new world without your eyes
once upon a time there was a girl who so much loved the world
she have her only begotten sunshine
and dried her stained eyes on a neck tie
took the best lies made em truths
and spit sad soliloquies in the booth
cause people think they know but they barely knew
the reality of what the othersiders do
but ive been there ive learnt that
seen a whole bunch of world and done came back
got a reckoning for wrecking in my knapsack
bout to journey on foot through the outback
grrrl prty is the label on my snapback
doin worldwide shows in a black hat
bout to tell your ass a story so take that
free prophecies from a black cat
seen his demise with a pair of brand new eyes
it was sickening guy
never wanted to be stickin it to thickening thighs
but now he deeper than the secrets that he keep with a lie
mm tastes good baby say with a cry
now wait
thinkin about it too much too much
deepen the profit sooner sooner
he never wanted to be a loser
but the bruises of losing is oozing through his fingers
the tips that like to brush at my hips
is now at the hilt of a sword lord
on the battlefield torn sworn
to never think about another lover
hopin he had time to recover but nothings ever easy
beware the sting of queen bee grr
and id like to thank you for the human ive become
im sorry if ive let you down
im trying im learning as i stumble along
to see this new world without your eyes
so many things in he i would like to be
wiser more light on my feet
i could look up in the mirror and change me
or right over my shoulder and save me
thinkin about back back when when i aint have nothing
not a thing or a ring to my name
now my feet in the game knee deep dont speak
feelin like gwen stefani in this thing
but i cant complain cause we asked for this
feelin like a workaholic or a masochist
dont call like i should like its sacrilege
to make a dollar in a dream into packed venues
take a second put your shield down
laying down my sword getting off the battlefield now
makin bigger moves bigger pictures in my view now
get up out of my way ive got ammo for days pow
i can feel the weight of wars youve lost
theyre victories in my eyes
every swing you take brings me closer and closer
open the gates and im poised to charge
you told me wed never get this far
now we at the final round
theres no way well escape battle scars
battle scars
and id like to thank you for the human ive become

the mask is off and the creature is coming through
out of the void that cuts between the eye and the screen
what does she see young futurist 1913
crystal ball looking down on me
who damns them all among the fallen
she who fell in with the yelling shiny metal boys
yes they knew theres an art to noise
that nows where the time ahead destroys the ashen past
but they left their caskets wide
half of them turned fascists while the other half died
whys it that a ticket out
is always a faustian deal with the devil

just give me a lever and a place to stand
i can move the world i can move the world
give me a lever and a place to stand

why does it shine with the disappeared
world war one and all to come
the spiral swallows up a hundred years
is it wrong that i long for correction
some invective retrospective court
to flex a hand around the necks of bush thatcher musk
bastards all who stacked the decks
so who is next
not benedetta cappa or the tablerapping foxes yet
tried to escape from their boxes
without a say in their age or their sex
besides who can test whether the perception i got is correct
whether im inventing a special effect
am i a lone tall tree in the woods unwrecked unchecked from dusk to sunset
where were you in 22 the death of solitude
the end of your tolerance for the call of a prophet
who fed you dreams or the fear of a bloody coup
but how did you get here what did they do to you
and when is now
i mean really what in hell is now
a junkie who caught between the memory of flight and terror of the night
begs what can my money do
thats what i get for having two eyes to read with see with
maybe size up the summer roughness
from above this burning forest californias poorest smoke on all horizons
who let all the flies into this version of my life am i dying
where were you in 22
go get your alibi son
make it a good lie
where were you in 22
where were you in 22
got one more window to look through
where were you

growing and churning without a border or safeguard
but blown back by the force of the past
the tyrannical gnashing of teeth and the panicking death screech
the angel of history is paralyzed by a shock to the spine called progress
trinity bomb test 1945
everybody ever alive when you rise ill fall and apologize
im so sorry im so sorry
i dreamed of kemdi amadiume where i could see the future
and im sorry was i all i could tell her
creation is sorry you deserved better
im so sorry sorry
the words echo wide to the first ever suicide in the kalahari
and everything tumbling after
hell of a way to conclude the first chapter
so where were you in 22
who am i talking to
the slaughterhouse animals in the cages all going blue
illegal to film but theyre killed for you to chew
and the angel is crying at the bronx zoo
are you talking to the meteor in space
youre hoping will break through come and erase
cut the gordian knot plot dissolves columns fall
all our problems going small
or are you talking to your parents whom you even still
make excuses for cause youre in the will
executor testatrix execution in the matrix
am i talking to entitled generational wealth
the feedback loop spins a fabergé shell
gilded with rubies and amber gels
waiting to be smashed cast a spell
hell i guess what i mean is take yourself back to fourteen
the first and only evening you could see with clarity right and wrong
and share with me do you owe that kid a song
or were you killed by the agefifteen version
and the guilt that made age sixteen worse
and seventeen eighteen like dominoes
and when they come can you tell where the kid goes
are you swallowing the previous minute down
does this verse chew the last and spit it out

dont blame the crocodile eating itself

emotions unfold like a superbloom in action
the universe hangs like a necklace from god

this is how were meant to be
cause were just highly emotional people

sometimes its hard to tell me how you feel
i never see you cry

all of the weight you have carried around
feelings come up then you push em back down
i feel your pain cause i know life is hard
but you can let go of the pain in your heart

you know its safe to tell me how you feel

people say men dont cry
its so much easier to just lie
til somebody takes their life

i was floating to heaven

my mind was heavy running ragged with worst case scenarios
emergency exits and the distance below
i woke up so worried that the angels let go

of being afraid
what would it feel like
to put this baggage down
if im being honest
im not sure id know how
i wanna take shelter but im ready ready to fight
and somewhere in the middle i feel a little paralyzed
but maybe im stronger than i realize
i wanna believe
no i choose to believe
that i was made to become
a sanctuary
fear wont go away
but i can keep it at bay
and these invisible walls
just might keep us safe
with a vigilant heart
ill push into the dark
and ill learn to breathe deep
and make peace with the stars
is it courage or faith
to show up every day
to trust that there will be light
always waiting behind
even the darkest of nights
and no matter what
somehow well be okay
dont be afraid",0

maybe i should continue to hurt your momma and diss her more
just to relieve the tension that sits in my heart cause it is sore
when im spittin bars about all my cash and exquisite cars
this was on my vision and you were the one i did it for
my relationship with your momma is sittin in the morgue

there was somethin in the headlights
that stopped me on a dime
well she was scared to death
so i said climb in and in she climbed
oh yeah
well she was bruised and broke from head to toe
with a tear in her bloodstained shirt
she didnt tell the whole truth but she didnt have to
i knew what had happenеd to her
i didnt load her down with questions
that girl had been through еnough
i just threw it in drive looked in those eyes
and asked her where he was
i dont know if hes an angel
cause angels dont do what he did
he was hellbent to find the man behind
all the whiskey scars i hid
i never thought my day of justice
would come from a judge under his seat
but i knew right then id never get hit again when he said to me
wait in the truck
just wait in the truck
well i knocked and knocked and no one came
so i kicked in his doublewide door
i let the hammer drop before he got
to that 12 he was reachin for
i didnt try to hide my pistol
i didnt even try to run
i just sat on the porch smokin one of his cigarettes
and waited for the cops to come
i dont know if hes an angel
cause angels dont do what he did
he was hellbent to find the man behind
all the whiskey scars i hid
i never thought my day of justice
would come from a judge under his seat
but i knew right then id never get hit again when he said to me
wait in the truck
just wait in the truck
whoa oh
have mercy on me lord
have mercy on me
have mercy on me lord oh
its been sixty months and she still comes
to see me from time to time
it was worth the price to see a brighter side
of the girl i picked up that night
and i might be here forever
it aint paradise thats true
but its a whole hell of a lot better
than the place i sent him to
yeah
have mercy have mercy have mercy on me

one flesh from the other

of rooms with a ragged interior
we hid under the lavender meadows
and pulled back infinite curtains

ill spend the night slamming doors
smoking outside my grandparents house

i feel like no one understands me anymore
nothing is how it was last year
but its cold and lonely just like before
its time to start over and move on
my grandma keeps going on about the new year

your head in the curtains and heart like the fourth of july
you swore and said we are not we are not shining stars

ive closed enough windows to know you can never look back
if youre lost and alone or youre sinkin like a stone
carry on
may your past be the sound of your feet upon the ground
carry on
carry on carry on
so i met up with some friends at the edge of the night
at a bar off 75
and we talked and talked about how our parents will die
all our neighbors and wives
but id like to think i can cheat it all
to make up for the times ive been cheated on
and its nice to know when i was left for dead
i was found and now i dont roam these streets
i am not the ghost you are to me
if youre lost and alone or youre sinkin like a stone
carry on
may your past be the sound of your feet upon the ground and
carry on
woah my head is on fire but my legs are fine
after all they are mine
lay your clothes down on the floor
close the door hold the phones

cause we are we are shining stars

on our darkest day when were miles away

i was runnin from my brother and his friends
and tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass i rolled down
i was younger then take me back to when i
found my heart and broke it here
made friends and lost them through the years
and ive not seen the roaring fields in so long i know ive grown
but i cant wait to go home
im on my way
drivin at ninety down those country lanes
singin to tiny dancer
and i miss the way you make me feel and its real
we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
fifteen years old and smoking handrolled cigarettes
runnin from the law through the backfields and gettin drunk with my friends
had my first kiss on a friday night i dont reckon that i did it right
but i was younger then take me back to when
we found weekend jobs when we got paid
wed buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
me and my friends have not thrown up in so long oh how weve grown

over the castle on the hill
one friend left to sell clothes
one works down by the coast
one had two kids but lives alone
ones brother overdosed
ones already on his second wife
ones just barely gettin by
but these people raised me
and i cant wait to go home
and im on my way i still remember
these old country lanes
when we did not know the answers

an evening i will not forget - acoustic,dermot kennedy,0SyCiolhBfPZNivoisaqGY,2015,250,60,-17,Minor,9,8A,5,55,16,97,0,16,8,"an evening i will not forget is a complex and clustered explosion of dermots feelings toward the relationship and break up with his childhood best friend and lover
he very meticulously crafts a song that read more when love was found
i kept my hope just like id hoped to
then sang to the sea for feelings deep blue
and coming down
and weve had problems that weve grown through
but i bet you dream of what you could do
at seventeen i was alright
was like nothing i could feel inside
and wishing you were here tonight is like holding on
but i still get to see your face right
and thats like nothing they can take right
so there wont be no feeling in the firelight
hoping thisll be right
time to show your worth child
i remember when her heart broke over stubborn shit
thats no way to be living kid
the angel of death is ruthless
and im always thinking summertime with the bikes out
pushing our luck getting wiped out
days with nothing but laughing loud
underneath my coat wont you tap my shoulder hold my hand
nights with nothing but dark in there
you could be my armor then
island smiles and cardigans
the nights that weve been drinking in
were here to help you kill all of this hurt that youve been harboring
confessions should be better planned
alone that night im surely damned
run away ill understand
whats important is this evening i will not forget
purple blue orange red
these colors of feeling give me love ill put my heart in it
and i think about it all the time
lights went out you were fine
you kinda struggle not to shine
i still love you though
i still love you though
i still love you always
so hold me when im home keep the evenings long
crack and break and part ways
i still love you though
i still love you though
i still love you always
so hold me when im home keep the evenings long
lets not crack and break and part ways
and i wonder if i could let her down
its for real its for real

especially when it happens hes an exile
from that dear lovely isle of inisfree
and when the moonlight peeps across the rooftops
of this great city wondrous though it be
i scarcely feel its wonder or laughter
im once again back home in inisfree
i wander oer green hills through dreamy valleys
and find a peace no other land could know
i hear the birds make music fit for angels
and watch the rivers laughing as they flow
and then into a humble shack i wander
my dear old home and tenderly behold
the folks i love around the turf fire gathered
on bended knee their rosary is told
but dreams dont last though dreams are not forgotten
and soon im back to stern reality
but though they pave the footways here with gold dust

some people have faith in the craziest things
they follow outdated conventions that were recorded
but most of it to me all sounds insane
maybe its all you need
to get you through the night
maybe youve seen the light
but you know that popular consensus doesnt make it right
nothing can go on while forever increasing
the universe expanding is a different thing
but to turn a nasty habit into a virtue
cant replace the need for charity
maybe its all you need
to help you through the night
maybe youve seen the light

i dont have pity for you black niggas thats the way i feel
screamin black lives matter
all the black guysd rather be deadbeats than pay your bills
yellin nigga this and nigga that
call everybody nigga and get a nigga mad
as soon as i say nigga then everyone react
and wanna swing at me and call me racist cause i aint black
well pound that then
talkin bout slavery like you was around back then
like you was pickin cotton off the fuckin ground back then
like you was on the plantation gettin down back then
aight look
i see a black man aimin his gun
but id rather see a black man claimin his son
and i dont mean just for one day and you done i mean
you still trapped in a rut
and i work my ass off and pay my taxes for what
so you can keep livin on free government assistance
food stamps for your children but you still tryna sell em
for some weed and some liquor or a fuckin babysitter
while you party on the road cause you aint got no fuckin goals
you already late
you motherfuckers need to get your damn priorities straight wait
its like youre proud to be fake
but you lazy as fuck
and youd rather sell drugs than get a job and be straight
and then you turn around and complain about the poverty rate fuck outta my face
you cant escape problems
you can pray for some change but cant break a dollar
got nobody else to blame so you blame donald
they fuck the world with a make america great condom
my voice been back
im not racist my sisters boyfriends black
im not racist my sisterinlaws baby cousin tracy got a brother and his girlfriends black
my heads in the cloud
heard theres not enough jobs for all the men in your house
maybe we should build a wall to keep the mexicans out
or maybe we should send em all to the ghetto for now
im not racist and i never lie
but i think theres a disconnect between your culture and mine
i worship the einsteins study the steve jobs
but you ride 2pacs dick like he was a fuckin god oh my god
and all you care about is rappin and stuntin and bein ratchet and thats the nigga within you
music rottin your brain and slowly start to convince you
then you let your kids listen and then the cycle continues
blame it all on the menu blame it on those drinks
blame it on everybody except for your own race
blame it on white privileges blame it on white kids
and just blame it on white citizens aim at the vice president
bunch of class clowns
niggas kneelin on the field thats a flag down
how dare you try to make demands for this money
you gon show us some respect you gon stand for this country nigga
im not racist im just prepared for this type of war
i heard eminems rap at the awards whos he fightin for
yall can take that motherfucker too he aint white no more
its like you wanna be so famous
youll do anything for attention and a little payment
i cant take you nowhere without people pointin fingers
pants hangin off your ass you aint got no home trainin
pull your fuckin pants up nigga
put that suit back on take that durag off
take that gold out your mouth quit the pitiful stuff
and then maybe policed stop killin you fucks yo what the fuck

im not racist
but theres two sides to every story i wish that i knew yours
i wish that i knew yours
im not racist i swear
with all disrespect
i dont really like you white motherfuckers thats just where im at
screaming all lives matter is a protest to my protest what kind of shit is that
and thats one war youll never win
the power in the word nigga is a different sin
we shouldnt say it but we do and thats just what it is
but that dont mean that you can say it just cause you got nigga friends
nigga
that word was originated for you to keep us under
and when we use it we know thats just how we greet each other
and when you use it we know theres a double meaning under
and even if i wasnt picking cotton physically
that dont mean im not affected by the history
my grandmama was a slave that shit gets to me
and you aint got no motherfuckin sympathy you pussy nigga
im sorry you can never feel my life
tryna have faith but i never felt alright
its hard to elevate when this countrys ran by whites
judging me by my skin color and my blackness
tryna find a job but aint nobody call me back yet
now i gotta sell drugs to put food in my cabinet
you crackers aint slick this is all a part of your tactics
dont talk about no motherfuckin taxes
when i aint making no dough
you think you know everything but you dont
you wanna copy our slang and everything that we know
try to steal black culture and then make it your own woah
fuck im exhausted
i cant even drive without the cops tryna start shit
im tired of the systematic racism bullshit
all you do is false shit this the shit that im forced with
and you dont know shit about my people thats what bothers you
you dont know about no fried chicken or no barbecue
you dont know about the twostep or no loose change
you dont know about no 2 chainz or no koolaid you dont know
and even though barack was half as black
you hated president obama i know thats a fact
you couldnt wait to get him out and put a cracker back
and then you gave us donald trump and now its payback for that
im not racist i never lied
but i know theres a disconnect between your culture and mines
yeah i praise 2pac like he was a fuckin god
he was fighting for his life way before he fuckin died nigga die nigga
and all you care about is money and power and being ugly and thats the cracker within you
hatred all in your brain it slowly start to convince you
and then you teach it to your children until the cycle continue
blame it on puerto rico blame it on oj
blame it on everybody except for your own race
blame it on black niggas and blame it on black citizens
aim at the black businesses i aint saying im innocent but
i might be any day now
treatin everybody how you want and any way how
i swear north korea bout to bomb us any day now
and now im duckin every time i hear a fuckin plane now shit
you know i make a lot of sense but you just cant admit it
when eminem went against trump that was the illest
cause even though hes white he let us know he standin with us
im not racist but i cry a lot
you dont know what its like to be in a frying pot
you dont know what its like to mind your business
and get stopped by the cops and not know if you bout to die or not
you worry bout your life so you take mine
i love you but i fuckin hate you at the same time
i wish we could trade shoes or we could change lives
so we could understand each other more but thatd take time
im not racist
its like we livin in the same building but split into both sides

i am afraid
please pray for me when i am away
comfort the girl
help her understand

and no violence no matter how bad
can darken the heart
or tear it apart
take my hand when you are scared
and i will pray if you go back out there
comfort the man
help him understand

can poison your voice

rough on the surface but you cut through like a knife

i never wouldve known from that look on your face
lost in your current like a priceless wine
the more that you say the less i know
wherever you stray i follow
im begging for you to take my hand
wreck my plans thats my man
life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
head on the pillow i could feel you sneakin in
as if you were a mythical thing
like you were a trophy or a champion ring
and there was one prize id cheat to win
the more that you say the less i know

you know that my train could take you home
anywhere else is hollow

they count me out time and time again
life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
but i come back stronger than a 90s trend
wait for the signal and ill meet you after dark
show me the places where the others gave you scars
now this is an openshut case
i guess i shouldve known from the look on your face

so let me feel right for one minute
chew me up spit me out
i dont wanna be alone

its not love if it doesnt hurt
if i break my teeth then will you see
and its not love its not love
till you bury me
heart versus head and i dont know who i want to win
because my heart always cares too much and my head couldnt care less

will you fall with me
will you be my anything my everything
ill be your anything if you dont leave

it is a hunger an endless aching need
i say love it is a flower

its the heart afraid of breaking
that never learns to dance
its the dream afraid of waking
that never takes a chance
its the one who wont be taken
who cannot seem to give
and the soul afraid of dying
that never learns to live
when the night has been too lonely

i told her im not really looking for another mistake
i called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
but then i jumped right in a week later returned
i reckon she was only lookin for a lover to burn
but i gave her my time for two or three nights
then i put it on pause until the moment was right
i went away for months until our paths crossed again
she told me i was never looking for a friend
maybe you could swing by my room around 10
baby bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
well be in between the sheets till the late am
baby if you wanted me then you should have just said shes singin
dont  with my love
that heart is so cold
all over my home
i dont wanna know that babe
dont  with my love
i told her she knows
take aim and reload
i dont wanna know that babe
and for a couple weeks i only wanna see her
we drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
before a text message was the only way to reach her
now shes stayin at my place and loves the way i treat her
singing out aretha all over the track like a feature
and never wants to sleep i guess that i dont want to either
but me and her we make money the same way
four cities two planes the same day
and those shows have never been what its about
but maybe well go together and just figure it out
id rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
but we should get on a plane or well be missin it now
wish id have written it down the way that things played out
when she was kissin him how i was confused about
now she should figure it out while im sat here singing

dont  with my love

take aim and reload

on my hotel door
i dont even know if she knows what for
she was cryin on my shoulder i already told ya
trust and respect is what we do this for
i never intended to be next get lost
but you didnt need to take him to bed thats all
and i never saw him as a threat get lost
until you disappeared with him to have sex of course
its not like we were both on tour
we were stayin on the same  hotel floor
and i wasnt lookin for a promise or commitment
but it was never just fun and i thought you were different
this is not the way you realised what you wanted
its a bit too much too late if im honest

amusing belly dancers distract me from my wine
across tibetan mountains are memories of mine

recorded here on paper my chills and thrills and spills

a grape to tempt your leisure romantic gestures strange
my eagle flies tomorrow its a game i treasure dear

and your mothers telling stories bout you on the teeball team
you taught me bout your past thinking your future was me

there was nothing else i could do
and i forget about you long enough
to forget why i needed to
cause there we are again in the middle of the night
were dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
down the stairs i was there
i remember it all too well yeah
and maybe we got lost in translation
maybe i asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a masterpiece
til you tore it all up
running scared i was there
i remember it all too well
and you call me up again
just to break me like a promise
so casually cruel in the name of being honest
im a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
cause i remember it all all all
too well
time wont fly its like im paralyzed by it
id like to be my old self again but im still trying to find it
after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
now you mail back my things and i walk home alone
but you keep my old scarf from that very first week
cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
you cant get rid of it
cause you remember it all too well yeah
cause there we are again when i loved you so
back before you lost the one real thing youve ever known
it was rare i was there

you remember about the girl with the golden hair

the end is in sight but your aim takes you out of the mark
loves dart broken apart
if youre walking in circles youll find yourself back at the start
in the near distance you see a form
you recognise the face but youre feeling warm
rub your eyes and see theres no one around
lie down for a while and shell stay with you till you move on

leaving footprints all over town

well i dreamt i was free
free from both truth and love
and they were free from me
dressed up like a businessman
making money off of war
messed up as a politician
taking money from the poor
no longer weighed down
by respect nor decency
no blood no faith
found no place for them to be
and i wore my crown
like a liars sword
cursed at the ground
that ive been walking on
ive been walking on
all last night
well i dreamt i was cold
started up a fire burning
us out of control
a face i barely recognize
was staring out from the smoke
then pointed at my blackened heart
but the broken voice then spoke
said plans are only wrecking balls
then life gets on its way
theres more to this than i recall
probably more than i could say
and if hate shall be your weapon
lonely death shall be your toll
and if profit is your motive
then emptiness your soul
emptiness your soul
all last night
well i dreamt i was gone
nothing left but ashes
a bitter taste upon your tongue
shadows in the market
where as a child i had once played
abandoned in the evening
like a bloodless serenade
every moment crashing
through my mind cold like the wind
that whistles down the promenade
where my love and i had been
no countenance no reason
for the things i may have done
left stripped and standing naked
in the place that i begun
all come undone
saw these strange days ",0

desire for the throne the weak have no right to remain conscious
one by one they will be set free

i walked along those snowy streets the windows full of toys
my mom and dad both held my hands a crowd was up ahead
they gathered round a man who sang and this is what he said
id like to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony
id like to hold it in my arms and keep it company
id like to see the world for once all standing handinhand
and hear them echo through the hills for peace throughout the land
then all at once he disappeared within a flash of light
his tattered coat was left behind his sleigh was taking flight
and still i hear that melody that echoed through the night
id like to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony
id like to hold it in my arms and keep it company
id like to see the world for once all standing handinhand
and hear them echo through the hills for peace throughout the land
sing it now ooh
as a child i asked the man in red
hey santa whats your christmas wish
and this is what he said
id like to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony
id like to hold it in my arms and keep it company
id like to see the world for once all standing handinhand standing handinhand
and hear them echo through the hills for peace throughout the land
id like to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony
then we hear now
id like to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony
ooh
id like to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony

fall in line now your minds full up stuck
life is a distraction in a dream
bundle of bees follow the breeze
lost love
they found you now
round em up
you got me now
well i never really had a clue
my hands are full of sandals
feet so tender bare
stumble in a cyclone of drones
theyre watching everything we cannot see
shanghai
you turn me on
oceania
you got me now
something
something so huge
before the delugе
no refuge
something
somеthing in the wild reeking of despair
some grand gesture gone and test your scant resolve
recontextualizing sex
your accidental rehab in a lab
century
century of roll
brasilia
oh you got me now
twilight falls so cold into the aching rooms
sign of love now is alive on grooves
life is a sequence in a routine
new test tube baby can be in tears upon the tracks
baby oh america
bad hit you got me now
something
something so huge
before the deluge
no refuge
something
something so huge
before the deluge
