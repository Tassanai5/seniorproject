you can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
like resignation to the end always the end
so when we found that we could not make sense
well you said that we would still be friends
but ill admit that i was glad it was over
but you didnt have to cut me off
make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
and i dont even need your love
but you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
no you didnt have to stoop so low
have your friends collect your records and then change your number
i guess that i dont need that though
now youre just somebody that i used to know
now youre just somebody that i used to know

now and then i think of all the times you screwed me over
but had me believing it was always something that id done

you said that you could let it go
and i wouldnt catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

cause i could draw my uncle was and i kept my room straight
i told my mom tears rushing down my face
shes like ben youve loved girls since before prek
trippin yeah i guess she had a point didnt she
a bunch of stereotypes all in my head
i remember doing the math like yeah im good at little league
a preconceived idea of what it all meant
for those that like the same sex had the characteristics
the rightwing conservatives think its a decision
and you can be cured with some treatment and religion
manmade rewiring of a predisposition
playing god aw nah here we go
america the brave still fears what we dont know
and god loves all his children is somehow forgotten

she keeps me warm

if i was gay i would think hiphop hates me
have you read the youtube comments lately
man thats gay gets dropped on the daily
weve become so numb to what were sayin
our culture founded from oppression
yet we dont have acceptance for em
call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board
a word rooted in hate yet our genre still ignores it
and gay is synonymous with the lesser
its the same hate thats caused wars from religion
gender to skin color the complexion of your pigment
the same fight that led people to walkouts and sitins
its human rights for everybody there is no difference
live on and be yourself
when i was at church they taught me something else
if you preach hate at the service those words arent anointed
that holy water that you soak in has been poisoned
when everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless
rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen
i might not be the same but thats not important
no freedom til were equal damn right i support it
and i cant change
even if i tried
even if i wanted to
my love my love my love
she keeps me warm
she keeps me warm
she keeps me warm
she keeps me warm
we press play dont press pause progress march on
with a veil over our eyes we turn our back on the cause
til the day that my uncles can be united by law
when kids are walking round the hallway
plagued by a pain in their heart
a world so hateful some would rather die than be who they are
and a certificate on paper isnt gonna solve it all
but its a damn good place to start
no laws gonna change us we have to change us
whatever god you believe in we come from the same one
strip away the fear underneath its all the same love
about time that we raised up sing

let loose crazy then get soaked
get wet from my body you know in the benz get in
whats up my baby in the mercedesbenz
the stars on the ceiling stellar has already left
but you know that this night youre for me
come climb on top of me send me your location ill pick you up
she wants me to play music for her
so the baby dances all the way down
we drank a couple bottles
and still she remembers that we did it yestеrday
she wants me to play music for her
so thе babe dances all the way down
we drank a couple bottles
and still she remembers that we did it yesterday
she has not yet forgotten how we spent time
we went to the club and the two of us danced close together
like dogs close together kisses and a couple drinks
she stayed by my side and said i think i fell in love
she smokes she drinks
shes a little devil small but spicy
i love it when she rubs it against my pants
she loves it you can see it in her face she enjoys it
shes got a boyfriend and doesnt behave
she tells me chill cause the relationship is broken
our bodies crash and crash
our mouths get together the leggings choke her
she wants me to play music for her
so the babe dances all the way down
we drank a couple bottles
and still she remembers that we did it yesterday
she wants me to play music for her
so the babe dances all the way down
we drank a couple bottles
and still she remembers that we did it yesterday
yesterday yesterday you were moving very well very well
she got covered in the smell of chanel
were a thousand degrees fahrenheit
shes hot and has a pretty face
you play music for her and she gets horny by herself
for the party she never holds back
a couple friends she completes the crew
but you mama you know i like you a lot
crazy come here get close all the way back
you and me will go on a fleeting journey
interstellar eat you out
we will both smoke marijuana
in my room on my rooftop and on my bed
bae i think youre getting a call answer tomorrow
dont let the fire die
on the amg listening to ruedas y cristal
burning poison that got me flying mami
a little kiss to the barbie so she dances close
slanty eyes like puki from taiwan an
like puki from taiwan
like puki from taiwan
i eat that pussy whenever i want mami mami

están haciendo leyes sobre lo que las mujeres pueden hacer

ocho palabras cuando pienso en nosotros es fóllame fóllame fóllame fóllame
te faltan el respeto y los golpearé

te dirán que es una noche fría te dirán que prefieren quedarse en casa sí
