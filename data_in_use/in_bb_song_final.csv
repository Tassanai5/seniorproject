trippin yeah i guess she had a point didnt she
a bunch of stereotypes all in my head
i remember doing the math like yeah im good at little league
a preconceived idea of what it all meant
for those that like the same sex had the characteristics
the rightwing conservatives think its a decision
and you can be cured with some treatment and religion
manmade rewiring of a predisposition
playing god aw nah here we go
america the brave still fears what we dont know
and god loves all his children is somehow forgotten

if i was gay i would think hiphop hates me
have you read the youtube comments lately
man thats gay gets dropped on the daily
weve become so numb to what were sayin
our culture founded from oppression
yet we dont have acceptance for em
call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board
a word rooted in hate yet our genre still ignores it
and gay is synonymous with the lesser
its the same hate thats caused wars from religion
gender to skin color the complexion of your pigment
the same fight that led people to walkouts and sitins
its human rights for everybody there is no difference
live on and be yourself
when i was at church they taught me something else
if you preach hate at the service those words arent anointed
that holy water that you soak in has been poisoned
when everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless
rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen
i might not be the same but thats not important
no freedom til were equal damn right i support it

with a veil over our eyes we turn our back on the cause
til the day that my uncles can be united by law
when kids are walking round the hallway
plagued by a pain in their heart
a world so hateful some would rather die than be who they are
and a certificate on paper isnt gonna solve it all
but its a damn good place to start
no laws gonna change us we have to change us
whatever god you believe in we come from the same one
strip away the fear underneath its all the same love
about time that we raised up sing
