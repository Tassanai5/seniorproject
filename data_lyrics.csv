0,Somebody That I Used to Know,Gotye,"Now and then, I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy, you could die
I told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember


You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well, you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that, though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know


Now and then, I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing (Ah)
And I don't even need your love (Ooh)
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough (Ah)
No, you didn't have to stoop so low (Ooh)
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number (Ah)
I guess that I don't need that, though (Ooh)
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Somebody (I used to know)
Somebody (Now you're just somebody that I used to know)
Somebody (I used to know)
Somebody (Now you're just somebody that I used to know)
(I used to know)
(That I used to know)
(I used to know)
Somebody"
1,Call Me Maybe,Carly Rae Jepsen,"173 ContributorsTranslationsTürkçeالعربيةDeutschEspañolCall Me Maybe Lyrics
I threw a wish in the well
Don't ask me, I'll never tell
I looked to you as it fell
And now you're in my way
I trade my soul for a wish
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn't lookin' for this
But now you're in my way

Your stare was holdin'
Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hot night, wind was blowin'
Where you think you're goin', baby?

Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
It's hard to look right at you, baby
But here's my number, so call me maybe
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me maybe

You took your time with the call
I took no time with the fall
You gave me nothin' at all
But still, you're in my way
I beg and borrow and steal
At first sight, and it's real
I didn't know I would feel it
But it's in my way

Your stare was holdin'
Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hot night, wind was blowin'
Where you think you're goin', baby?

Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
It's hard to look right at you, baby
But here's my number, so call me maybe
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me maybe

Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad
I missed you so bad, I missed you so, so bad
Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad
And you should know that, I missed you so, so bad

It's hard to look right at you, baby
But here's my number, so call me maybe

Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
It's hard to look right at you, baby
But here's my number, so call me maybe

Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad
I missed you so bad, I missed you so, so bad
Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad
And you should know that, so call me maybe"
2,We Are Young,Fun,"Give me a second I, I need to get my story straight
My friends are in the bathroom getting higher than the Empire State
My lover, she is waiting for me just across the bar
My seat's been taken by some sunglasses askin' 'bout a scar, and
I know I gave it to you months ago
I know you're tryin' to forget
But between the drinks and subtle things
The holes in my apologies
You know, I'm tryin' hard to take it back

So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like fallin' down
I'll carry you home

Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

Now I know that I'm not all that you got
I guess that I, I just thought
Maybe we could find new ways to fall apart
But our friends are back, so let's raise a toast
'Cause I found someone to carry me home

Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

Carry me home tonight
(Na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na)
Just carry me home tonight
(Na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na)
Carry me home tonight
(Na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na)
Just carry me home tonight
(Na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na)
(Na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na)
The moon is on my side, I have no reason to run
(Na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na)
So will someone come and carry me home tonight?
(Na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na)
The angels never arrived, but I can hear the choir
(Na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na)
So will someone come and carry me home?

Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

3,Payphone,Maroon 5,"I'm at a payphone, tryin' to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down

I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

I'm at a payphone, tryin' to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?
If happy-ever-afters did exist
I would still be holdin' you like this
All those fairytales are full of shit
One more fuckin' love song, I'll be sick, oh

You turned your back on tomorrow
'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine (Oh)
I don't expect you to care (Yeah)
I know I said it before, but
All of our bridges burned down

I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed (Oh)
Still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

I'm at a payphone, tryin' to call home
All of my change I spent on you (Oh, oh)
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two? (Yeah)
If happy-ever-afters did exist
I would still be holdin' you like this
And all those fairytales are full of shit
One more fuckin' love song, I'll be sick (Uh)
Now I'm at a payphone

Man, fuck that shit
I be out spendin' all this money while you sittin' 'round
Wonderin' why it wasn't you who came up from nothin'
Made it from the bottom, now when you see me, I'm stuntin'
And all of my cars start with the push of a button
Tellin' me I changed since I blew up or whatever you call it
Switched the number to my phone so you never could call it
Don't need my name on my shirt, you can tell that I'm ballin'
Swish, what a shame, coulda got picked
Had a really good game, but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you coulda saw, but sad to say it's over for
Phantom pulled up, valet open doors
Wished I'd go away, got what you was looking for
Now it's me who they want
So you can go and take that little piece of shit with you

Yeah, I'm at a payphone, tryin' to call home
All of my change I spent on you (Woo)
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong (Yeah)
Where are the plans we made for two? (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
If happy-ever-after's did exist (Oh, then)
I would still be holdin' you like this
And all these fairytales are full of shit (Yeah)
One more fuckin' love song, I'll be sick
Yeah, now I'm at a payphone"
4,Lights,Ellie Goulding,"I had a way then
Losing it all on my own
I had a heart then
But the queen has been overthrown
And I'm not sleeping now
The dark is too hard to beat
And I'm not keeping now
The strength I need to push me

You show the lights that stop me, turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone
'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me, turn to stone (Home)
You shine it when I'm alone (Home)

Noises
I play within my head
Touch my own skin
And hope that I'm still breathin'
And I think back to when
My brother and my sister slept
In an unlocked place
The only time I feel safe

You show the lights that stop me, turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone
'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me, turn to stone (Home)
You shine it when I'm alone (Home)

(Lights, lights, lights, lights)
(Lights, lights, lights, lights)
Home, home (Lights, lights, lights, lights)
(Lights, lights)

You show the lights that stop me, turn to stone
You shine it when I'm alone
And so I tell myself that I'll be strong
And dreaming when they're gone
'Cause they're calling, calling, calling me home
Calling, calling, calling home
You show the lights that stop me, turn to stone (Home)
You shine it when I'm alone (Home)

5,Glad You Came,The Wanted,"The sun goes down, the stars come out
And all that counts is here and now
My universe will never be the same
I'm glad you came

You cast a spell on me, spell on me
You hit me like the sky fell on me, fell on me
And I decided you look well on me, well on me
So let's go somewhere no one else can see, you and me
Turn the lights out now
Now, I'll take you by the hand
Hand you another drink
Drink it if you can
Can you spend a little time?
Time is slipping away
Away from us, so stay
Stay with me, I can make
Make you glad you came

The sun goes down, the stars come out
And all that counts is here and now
My universe will never be the same
I'm glad you came, I'm glad you came

You cast a spell on me, spell on me
You hit me like the sky fell on me, fell on me
And I decided you look well on me, well on me
So let's go somewhere no one else can see, you and me
Turn the lights out now
Now, I'll take you by the hand
Hand you another drink
Drink it if you can

6,Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You),Kelly Clarkson,"You know the bed feels warmer
Sleepin' here alone (Sleepin' here alone)
You know I dream in color
And do the things I want (Do the things I want)

You think you got the best of me
Think you've had the last laugh
Bet you think that everything good is gone
Think you left me broken down
Think that I'll come running back
Baby, you don't know me, 'cause you're dead wrong

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over 'cause you're gone
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself, and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

You heard that I was starting over with someone new
They told you I was moving on and over you

You didn't think that I'd come back
I'd come back swinging
You tried to break me, but you see

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over 'cause you're gone
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself, and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

Thanks to you, I got a new thing started
Thanks to you, I'm not the broken-hearted
Thanks to you I'm finally thinkin' 'bout me
You know in the end, the day you left was just my beginning
In the end

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over 'cause you're gone
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself, and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone (What doesn't kill you)
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself, and I (What doesn't kill you)
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger (Stronger)
Stand a little taller (Taller)
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone (What doesn't kill you)

7,We Found Love,Rihanna,"Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standin' side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive

It's the way I'm feelin', I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place


Shine a light through an open door
Love and life, I will divide
Turn away 'cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind

It's the way I'm feelin', I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go-ooh-oh

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standin' side by side
As your shadow crosses mine

We found love in a hopeless place

9,What Makes You Beautiful,One Direction,"You're insecure, don't know what for
You're turnin' heads when you walk through the door
Don't need makeup to cover up (Huh)
Bein' the way that you are is enough

Everyone else in the room can see it

Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed

Show me how you do
I wanna shut down the club with you
Hey, I heard you like the wild ones, wild ones, wild ones
Ooh, ooh

Oh, I-I like crazy, foolish, stupid
Party goin' wild, fist pumpin' music
I might lose it, glass to the roof
That's how we do's it, do's it, do's it
I don't care tonight, she don't care we like
Almost there, the right vibe, ready to get live
Ain't no surprise, take me so high
Jump and nose dive, surfin’ the crowd

Said, I gotta be the man, I'm the head of my band
Mic check, one, two
Shut 'em down in the club, what a playboy does
'Til they all get loose, loose off the bottle
We all get bent then again tomorrow
Gotta break rules 'cause that's the motto

So cool, no doubt by the end of the night
Got the clothes comin' off then I make that move
Somehow, some way, gotta raise the roof, roof
All black shades when the sun come through

Wild out, baby, 'til the freak, it shows
What happens to that body is a private show
Stays right here, pri-private show

My life, call my homie then we hit Spain
Keep it busy with the bail, we get insane

Saddle me up and let's begin (Yeah)
I am a wild one, tame me now (Now)
Running with wolves and I'm on the prowl
Show you another side of me
A side you would never thought you would see
Tear up that body, dominate you 'til you've had enough
I hear you like the wild stuff

Hey, I heard you were a wild one

11,Set Fire to the Rain,Adele,"I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark, and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands, they were strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name
Your name

When I lay with you
I could stay there, close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together, nothing is better

'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name
Your name
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When we fell, somethin' died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time
The last time

Sometimes, I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waitin' for you
Even now, when we're already over
I can't help myself from lookin' for you

I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name
Your name
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When we fell, somethin' died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time
The last time

Let it burn

13,Some Nights,Fun,"Some nights, I stay up cashin' in my bad luck
Some nights, I call it a draw
Some nights, I wish that my lips could build a castle
Some nights, I wish they'd just fall off
But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh, Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for, oh
(Oh-ooh, oh, oh) What do I stand for?
(Oh-ooh, oh, oh) What do I stand for?
Most nights, I don't know anymore

Oh, oh, oh-ooh, oh, oh
Oh-ooh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-ooh, oh, oh
Oh-ooh, oh, oh, oh-oh

This is it, boys, this is war
(Oh, oh, oh-ooh, oh, oh)
What are we waiting for?
(Oh-ooh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
Why don't we break the rules already?
I was never one to believe the hype
(Oh, oh, oh-ooh, oh, oh)
Save that for the black and white
(Oh-ooh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
Try twice as hard, and I'm half as liked
But here they come again to jack my style

And that's alright (That's alright)
I found a martyr in my bed tonight
She stops my bones from wondering
Just who I, who I, who I
Am, oh, who am I? Mm-mm
Mm-mm

Well, some nights, I wish that this all would end
'Cause I could use some friends for a change
And some nights, I'm scared you'll forget me again
Some nights, I always win (I always win)
But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh, Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for, oh
(Oh-ooh, oh, oh) What do I stand for?
(Oh-ooh, oh, oh) What do I stand for?
Most nights, I don't know

(Oh, come on) So this is it?
I sold my soul for this?
Washed my hands of that for this?
I miss my mom and dad for this?
(Oh, come on) No, when I see stars, when I see
When I see stars, that's all they are
When I hear songs, they sound like a swan
So come on, oh, come on
Oh, come on, oh, come on

Well, that is it, guys, that is all
(Oh, oh, oh-ooh, oh, oh)
Five minutes in, and I'm bored again
(Oh-ooh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
Ten years of this, I'm not sure if anybody understands
This one is not for the folks at home
(Oh, oh, oh-ooh, oh, oh)
Sorry to leave, Mom, I had to go
(Oh-ooh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
Who the fuck wants to die alone
All dried up in the desert sun?

My heart is breakin' for my sister
And the con that she called ""love""
And then I look into my nephew's eyes
Man, you wouldn't believe
The most amazing things
That can come from
Some terrible nights

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah (Alright, come on)

Oh, oh, oh-ooh, oh, oh
Oh-ooh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-ooh, oh, oh
Oh-ooh, oh, oh, oh-oh

The other night, you wouldn't believe
The dream I just had about you and me
I'd called you up, but we both agreed
It's for the best you didn't listen, no
It's for the best we get our distance, oh-oh-oh
For the best, you didn't listen
It's for the best we get our distance, oh-oh-oh-oh"

That everything you see ain't always what it seems

Fallin' from cloud nine
Crashin' from the high
I'm letting go tonight

Need nothing to complete myself, no

Yeah, I am born again
Out of the lion's den, I don't have to pretend
(And it's too late)
The story's over now, the end

I wish I knew then what I know now
Wouldn't dive in, wouldn't bow down
Gravity hurts, you made it so sweet
'Til I woke up on, on the concrete

Fallin' from cloud nine (It was outta the blue, I'm)
Crashin' from the high
I'm letting go tonight (Yeah, I'm letting you go, I'm)
I'm fallin' from cloud nine

(I'm wide awake)
Thunder rumbling
Castles crumbling (I'm wide awake)
I am tryin' to hold on
(I'm wide awake)
God knows that I tried
Seeing the bright side (I'm wide awake)
But I'm not blind anymore

I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake

Yeah, I'm fallin' from cloud nine (It was outta the blue, I'm)
Crashin' from the high
You know I'm letting go tonight (Yeah, I'm letting you go, I'm)

Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

You and I go hard at each other like we're going to war
You and I go rough, we keep throwing things and slamming the doors
You and I get so damn dysfunctional, we stopped keeping score
You and I get sick, yeah, I know that we can't do this no more

Yeah but baby, there you go again, there you go again
Making me love you
Yeah, I stopped using my head, using my head
Let it all go
Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo
And now I'm feeling stupid, feeling stupid crawling back to you

So I cross my heart, and I hope to die
That I'll only stay with you one more night
And I know I've said it a million times
But I'll only stay with you one more night

Try to tell you ""no,"" but my body keeps on telling you ""yes""
Try to tell you ""stop,"" but your lipstick got me so out of breath
I'll be waking up in the morning, probably hating myself
And I'll be waking up, feeling satisfied, but guilty as hell

Yeah but baby, there you go again, there you go again
Making me love you (Making me love you)
Yeah, I stopped using my head, using my head
Let it all go (Let it all go)
Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo (Like a tattoo, yeah)
And now I'm feeling stupid, feeling stupid crawling back to you

So I cross my heart, and I hope to die (Yeah)
That I'll only stay with you one more night (Oh)
And I know I've said it a million times (Yeah)
But I'll only stay with you one more night (Yeah)

(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Yeah, baby, give me one more night
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Yeah, baby, give me one more night (Woah, yeah)
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Yeah, baby, give me one more night
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Oh yeah yeah

But baby, there you go again, there you go again
Making me love you
Yeah, I stopped using my head, using my head
Let it all go
Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

So I cross my heart, and I hope to die (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
That I'll only stay with you one more night (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
And I know I've said it a million times
(Oh, I've said it a million times)
But I'll only stay with you one more night

So I cross my heart and I hope to die (Yeah, yeah)

18,Drive By,Train,"57 ContributorsDrive By LyricsThe lead single from Train’s latest album, California 37, here, Pat Monahan, the lead singer of Train, tries to make his lover believe in his claim that their relationship, was not just a one night stand.
On the other side of a street I knew
Stood a girl that looked like you
I guess that's déjà vu
But I thought this can't be true
'Cause you moved to west L.A. or New York or Santa Fe
Or wherever to get away from me

Oh, but that one night
Was more than just right
I didn't leave you 'cause I was all through
Oh, I was overwhelmed, and frankly, scared as hell
Because I really fell for you

Oh, I swear to you
I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy looking for a two-ply
Hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me, everything is groovy
They don't like it, sue me
Mmm, the way you do me
Oh, I swear to you
I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by

On the upside of a downward spiral
My love for you went viral
And I loved you every mile you drove away
But now, here you are again
So, let's skip the ""How you been?""
And get down to the ""more than friends"" at last

Oh, but that one night
Is still the highlight
I didn't need you until I came to
And I was overwhelmed, and frankly, scared as hell
Because I really fell for you

Oh, I swear to you
I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy looking for a two-ply
Hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me, everything is groovy
They don't like it, sue me
Mmm, the way you do me
Oh, I swear to you
I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by

Please believe
That when I leave
There's nothing up my sleeve but love for you
And a little time to get my head together too

On the other side of a street I knew
Stood a girl that looked like you
I guess that's déjà vu
But I thought this can't be true
'Cause...

Oh, I swear to you
I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy looking for a two-ply
Hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me, everything is groovy
They don't like it, sue me
Mmm, the way you do me
Oh, I swear to you
I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by"
19,The Motto,Drake,"262 ContributorsThe Motto LyricsOn this bonus track from Take Care, Drake enlists his Young Money mentor Lil Wayne for an ode to his motto in life: YOLO.
I'm the fuckin' man, y'all don't get it, do ya?
Type of money, everybody acting like they knew ya
Go Uptown, New York City, bitch
Them Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami too
Clubbin' hard, fuckin' women, there ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up on Biscayne
Still gettin' brain from a thang, ain't shit changed
How you feel, how you feel, how you feel?
Twenty-five, sitting on twenty-five mil', uh
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace Mac Dre, I'ma do it for the Bay, okay
Gettin' paid, we'll holler whenever that stop
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune light one, pass it like a relay
YMCMB, you niggas more YMCA
Me, Franny, and Mally Mall at the crib-o
Shout goes out to Niko, J, and Chubbs, shout to Gibbo
We got Santa Margherita by the liter
She know even if I'm fucking with her, I don't really need her
Aww, that's how you feel, man? That's really how you feel?
'Cause the pimpin' ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill
I mean maybe she won't, then again, maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal, real nigga, what's up?

Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once, that's the motto, nigga, YOLO
And we 'bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin' on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em 'cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?

One time, fuck one time
I'm callin' niggas out like the umpire
Seven grams in the blunt
Almost drowned in her pussy, so I swam to her butt
It's Eastside, we in this bitch
Wish a nigga would like a tree in this bitch
And if a leaf fall, put some weed in that bitch
That's my MO, add a B to that shit
I'm fucked up, tore down
I'm twisted, doorknob
Talk stupid, off with your head
Nigga, money talks, and Mr. Ed, yeah
I'm so Young Money
Got a drum on the gun, Energizer Bunny
Funny how honey ain't sweet like sugar
Ain't shit sweet, niggas on the street like hookers
I tongue-kiss her other tongue
Skeet, skeet, skeet, water gun
Oh my God, Becky, look at her butt, Tunechi

Now she want a photo, you already know, though (Yeah)
You only live once, that's the motto, nigga, YOLO
And we 'bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin' on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em 'cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?
Real nigga, what's up?
Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once, that's the motto, nigga, YOLO
And we 'bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin' on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em 'cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?"

I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you (I'll take, I'll take)
I've loved and I've lost

I've asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn't change and I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun? Please don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know
They won't get you like I will, my only wish is I die real
'Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinkin' that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all in the pillowcase
Big girls all get a little taste, aw
Pushing me away so I give her space, aw
Dealin' with a heart that I didn't break
I'll be there for you, I would care for you
I keep thinking you just don't know
Tryna run from that, say you done with that
On your face, girl, it just don't show
When you're ready, just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
And the party's over, just don't forget me
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won't ever have to worry
You won't ever have to hide
And you've seen all my mistakes
So look me in my eyes

'Cause if you let me
Here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you (I'll take, I'll take)
I've loved and I've lost

It's my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
Can't deny that I want you, but I'll lie if I have to
'Cause you don't say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do, you do
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're followin' your heart
'Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights, though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know
You hate bein' alone, well, you ain't the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream and they sold you one
You love your friends, but somebody should've told you somethin'
To save you, instead, they say

Don't, tell me, I don't care if you hurt
I don't, tell you, you don't care if you're true
Don't, tell me, I don't care if you hurt
I don't, tell you, you don't care if you're true

I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you (I'll take, I'll take)
I've loved and I've lost"

Shoot me down, but I get up

I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, you take your aim
Fire away, fire away
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium


Cut me down, but it's you who'll have further to fall
Ghost town and haunted love
Raise your voice, sticks and stones may break my bones
Talking loud, not saying much

I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Ricochet, you take your aim
Fire away, fire away
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium

I am titanium
I am titanium

Stone heart, machine gun
Firing at the ones who run
Stone heart that was bulletproof glass

You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down, but I won't fall
I am titanium

I am titanium"
24,I Won't Give Up,Jason Mraz,"When I look into your eyes
It's like watching the night sky
Or a beautiful sunrise
Well, there's so much they hold
And just like them old stars
I see that you've come so far
To be right where you are
How old is your soul?

Well, I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up

And when you're needing your space
To do some navigating
I'll be here patiently waiting
To see what you find

'Cause even the stars, they burn
Some even fall to the earth
We've got a lot to learn
God knows we're worth it
No, I won't give up

I don't wanna be someone who walks away so easily
I'm here to stay and make the difference that I can make
Our differences, they do a lot to teach us how to use the tools and gifts
We got, yeah, we got a lot at stake
And in the end, you're still my friend, at least we did intend
For us to work, we didn't break, we didn't burn
We had to learn, how to bend without the world caving in
I had to learn what I got, and what I'm not
And who I am

I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up
I'm still looking up
Well, I won't give up on us (No, I won't give it up)
God knows I'm tough enough (I am tough, I am loved)
We got a lot to learn (We're alive, we are love)
God knows we're worth it (And we're worth it)

I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up"
25,It Will Rain,Bruno Mars,"73 ContributorsTranslationsDeutschIt Will Rain Lyrics
If you ever leave me, baby
Leave some morphine at my door
'Cause it would take a whole lot of medication
To realize what we used to have
We don't have it anymore
There's no religion that could save me
No matter how long my knees are on the floor, oh
So keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm makin'
To keep you by my side
To keep you from walkin' out the door

'Cause there'll be no sunlight, if I lose you, baby
There'll be no clear skies, if I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds, my eyes will do the same
If you walk away, every day, it'll rain, rain, rain

I'll never be your mother's favorite
Your daddy can't even look me in the eye
Ooh, if I was in their shoes, I'd be doin' the same thing
Sayin', ""There goes my little girl
Walkin' with that troublesome guy""
But they're just afraid of somethin' they can't understand
Ooh, but, little darlin', watch me change their minds
Yeah, for you, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try

And pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleedin'
If that'll make you mine

'Cause there'll be no sunlight, if I lose you, baby
There'll be no clear skies, if I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds, my eyes will do the same
If you walk away, every day it'll rain, rain, rain

Oh, don't you say (Don't you say) goodbye (Goodbye)
Don't you say (Don't you say) goodbye (Goodbye)

I'll pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleedin'
If that'll make it right

'Cause there'll be no sunlight, if I lose you, baby
There'll be no clear skies, if I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds, my eyes will do the same
If you walk away, every day it'll rain, rain, rain"

29,Too Close,Alex Clare,"You know I'm not one to break promises
I don't want to hurt you, but I need to breathe
At the end of it all, you're still my best friend
But there's something inside that I need to release

Which way is right?
Which way is wrong?
How do I say that I need to move on?
You know we're heading separate ways

And it feels like I am just too close to love you
There's nothing I can really say
I can't lie no more
I can't hide no more
Got to be true to myself
And it feels like I am just too close to love you
So I'll be on my way

You've given me more than I can return
Yet there's oh so much that you deserve
Nothing to say, nothing to do
I've nothing to give, I must live without you
You know we're heading separate ways

And it feels like I am just too close to love you
There's nothing I can really say
I can't lie no more
I can't hide no more
Got to be true to myself
And it feels like I am just too close to love you
So I'll be on my way

So I'll be on my way

And it feels like I am just too close to love you

30,Part of Me,Katy Perry,"Days like this, I want to drive away
Pack my bags and watch your shadow fade

You chewed me up and spit me out
Like I was poison in your mouth
You took my light, you drained me down
But that was then and this is now
Now look at me

This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you're not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no

I just wanna throw my phone away
Find out who is really there for me

You ripped me off, your love was cheap
Was always tearing at the seams
I fell deep, you let me drown
But that was then and this is now
Now look at me

This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you're not gonna break my soul
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no

Now look at me, I'm sparkling
A firework, a dancing flame
You won't ever put me out again
I'm glowing, oh whoa
So you can keep the diamond ring
It don't mean nothing anyway
In fact, you can keep everything, yeah, yeah
Except for me

This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no (Away from me)
Throw your sticks and your stones
Throw your bombs and your blows
But you're not gonna break my soul (My soul)

The song features a drum sample from Tom Scott’s “Sneakin' in the Back.”
Is this thing on? Word

So what we get drunk?
So what we smoke weed?
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees (Shit)
So what we go out? (Ayy, lemme get a lighter, please?)
That's how it's supposed to be ('Cause you know I'm high as fuck and I forgot one)
Living young and wild and free (Keep that in there)

Ah, ah-ah
So what, I keep 'em rolled up?
Saggin' my pants, not carin' what I show
Keep it real with my niggas, keep it player for these hoes
It look clean, don't it?
Washed it the other day, watch how you lean on it
Give me some 501 jeans on it
Roll joints bigger than King Kong's fingers
And smoke them hoes down 'til they stingers
You a class clown and if I skip for the day
I'm with your bitch smokin' grade A

You know what? It's like I'm seventeen again
Peach fuzz on my face, lookin' on the case
Tryna find a hella taste, oh, my God
I'm on the chase, Chevy, It's gettin' kinda heavy, relevant, sellin' it
Dippin' away, time keeps slippin' away
Zip in the safe, flippin' for pay
Tippin' like I'm drippin' in paint
Upfront, four blunts, like, ""Khalifa put the weed in a J""

So what we get drunk?
So what we smoke weed?
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out?
That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

Uh, and I don't even care
'Cause if me and my team in there
There's gon' be some weed in the air
Tell 'em, Mac
Blowin' everywhere we goin' and now you knowin'
When I step right up, get my lighter so I can light up
That's how it should be done
Soon as you thinkin' you're down
Find how to turn things around
Now things are lookin' up
From the ground up, pound up, this Taylor Gang
So turn my sound up and mount up and do my thang
Uh, now I'm chillin', fresh outta class, feelin'
Like I'm on my own and I could probably own a building
Got my own car, no job, no children
Had a science project, me and Mac killed it
T-H-C, M-A-C, D-E-V, H-D-3, high as me
This is us, we gon' fuss
And we gon' fight and we gon' roll
And live off life

So what we get drunk?
So what we smoke weed?
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out?
That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

Yeah, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this, you're supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just havin' fun
So we just roll one, smoke one
When you live like this, you're supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just havin' fun

So what we get drunk?
So what we smoke weed?
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out?
That's how it's supposed to be

32,We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,Taylor Swift,"I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, ""This is it, I've had enough,"" 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space (What?)
Then you come around again and say
""Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me""
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, ""I hate you,"" we break up, you call me, ""I love you""

We called it off again last night, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together
Like, ever

I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

You called me up again tonight, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Like, we are never getting back together, like, ever""

The one that I argue with, feel like I need a new girl to be bothered with
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side
It's green where you water it
So I know, we got issues, baby, true, true, true
But I'd rather work on this with you
Than to go ahead and start with someone new
As long as you love me

As long as you love me (Yeah, yeah, baby)
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum (Platinum), I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold

As long as you love me
As long as you love me
As long as you love me (I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold)
As long as you love me, you love me, you love me (It's all I want, baby)
As long as you love me, you love me (Please don't go)
As long as you love me, as long as you love me
As long as you love me, yeah
As long as you love me"

36,Blow Me (One Last Kiss),Pink,"34 ContributorsBlow Me (One Last Kiss) Lyrics“Blow Me (One Last Kiss)” is a song by American singer Pink, released as the lead single from her sixth album, The Truth About Love.
White knuckles
And sweaty palms from hanging on too tight
Clenched shut jaw
I've got another headache again tonight
Eyes on fire, eyes on fire
And they burn from all the tears
I've been crying, I've been crying
I've been dying over you
Tie a knot in the rope
Tryna hold, tryna to hold
But there's nothing to grab
So I let go

I think I finally had enough
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us
Blow me one last kiss
You think I'm just too serious
I think you're full of shit
My head is spinning so
Blow me one last kiss
Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
You had a shit day
We've had a shit day
I think that life's too short for this
I want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this
Blow me one last kiss

I won't miss
All of the fighting that we always did
Take it in
I mean what I say when I say there is nothing left
No more sick Whiskey dick
No more battles for me
You'll be calling a trick
'Cause you no longer sleep
I'll dress nice, I'll look good
I'll go dancing alone
I will laugh, I'll get drunk
I'll take somebody home

I think I finally had enough
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us
Blow me one last kiss
You think I'm just too serious
I think you're full of shit
My head is spinning so
Blow me one last kiss
Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
You had a shit day
We've had a shit day
I think that life's too short for this
I want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this
Blow me one last kiss

Da, da, da-da, da-da, da, da-da
Blow me one last kiss
Da, da, da-da, da-da, da, da-da
Blow me one last kiss

I will do what I please
Anything that I want
I will breathe, I will breathe
I won't worry at all
You will pay for your sins
You'll be sorry, my dear
All the lies, all the ""whys"" will all be crystal clear

I think I finally had enough
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us
Blow me one last kiss
You think I'm just too serious
I think you're full of shit
My head is spinning so
Blow me one last kiss
Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
You had a shit day
We've had a shit day
I think that life's too short for this
I want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this
Blow me one last kiss

La-la, la-la, da, da-da
La-la, la-la, da, da-da

Blow me one last kiss
La-la, la-la, da, da-da
La-la, la-la, da, da-da
La-la, la-la, da, da-da
Blow me one last kiss

Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
Have you had a shit day?
We've had a shit day
I think that life's too short for this
I want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this
Blow me one last kiss

Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
You had a shit day
We've had a shit day
I think that life's too short for this
I want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this
Blow me one last kiss"

Hopped into a cab, take me anywhere

38,Give Your Heart a Break,Demi Lovato,"The day I first met you
You told me you'd never fall in love
But now that I get you
I know fear is what it really was

Now here we are, so close
Yet so far, haven't I passed the test?
When will you realize
Baby, I'm not like the rest?

Don't wanna break your heart, wanna give your heart a break
I know you're scared it's wrong, like you might make a mistake
There's just one life to live and there's no time to wait, to waste
So let me give your heart a break

Give your heart a break, let me give your heart a break
Your heart a break, oh yeah, yeah

On Sunday, you went home
Alone, there were tears in your eyes
I called your cell phone
My love, but you did not reply

The world is ours if we want it
We can take it, if you just take my hand
There's no turning back now
Baby, try to understand

Don't wanna break your heart, wanna give your heart a break
I know you're scared it's wrong, like you might make a mistake
There's just one life to live and there's no time to wait, to waste
So let me give your heart a break

Give your heart a break, let me give your heart a break
Your heart a break, there's just so much you can take
Give your heart a break, let me give your heart a break
Your heart a break, oh yeah, yeah

When your lips are on my lips
Then our hearts beat as one
But you slip out of my fingertips
Every time you run
Woah, woah

Don't wanna break your heart, wanna give your heart a break (Don't wanna break your heart)
I know you're scared it's wrong, like you might make a mistake (I know you're scared it's wrong)
There's just one life to live and there's no time to wait, to waste
So let me give your heart a break (Let me give your heart)
'Cause you've been hurt before, I can see it in your eyes
You try to smile it away, some things, you can't disguise
Don't wanna break your heart, baby, I can ease the ache, the ache
So let me give your heart a break

Give your heart a break, let me give your heart a break
Your heart a break, there's just so much you can take
Give your heart a break, let me give your heart a break (Your heart)
Your heart a break (A break), oh yeah, yeah

The day I first met you
You told me you'd never fall in love"
39,Niggas in Paris,Jay-Z,"We're gonna skate to one song, one song only
Ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna fine me
So I ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna fine me
But first niggas gotta find me
What's fifty grand to a motherfucker like me? Can you please remind me?
(Ball so hard) This shit crazy
Y'all don't know that don't shit faze me
The Nets could go 0 for 82
And I'd look at you like this shit gravy
(Ball so hard) This shit weird
We ain't even 'posed to be here
(Ball so hard) Since we here
It's only right that we'd be fair
Psycho, I'm liable to go Michael, take your pick
Jackson, Tyson, Jordan, Game 6
(Ball so hard) Got a broke clock
Rollies that don't tick-tock
Audemars that's losing time
Hidden behind all these big rocks
(B-ball so hard) I'm shocked too
I'm supposed to be locked up too
You escaped what I escaped
You'd be in Paris getting fucked up too
(B-ball so hard) Let's get faded
Le Meurice for like six days
Gold bottles, scold models
Spillin' Ace on my sick J's
(Ball so hard) Bitch, behave
Just might let you meet Ye
Chi-Town's D. Rose
I'm moving the Nets, BK

Ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna fine me
That shit cray, that shit cray, that shit cray
B-ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna fine me
That shit cray, that shit cray, that shit cray

She said, ""Ye, can we get married at the mall?""
I said, ""Look, you need to crawl 'fore you ball""
Come and meet me in the bathroom stall
And show me why you deserve to have it all
(Ball so hard) That shit cray, ain't it, Jay?
(B-ball so hard) What she order, fish fillet?
(B-ball so hard) Your whip so cold, this old thing?
(Ball so hard) Act like you'll ever be around motherfuckers like this again
Bougie girl, grab her hand
Fuck that bitch, she don't wanna dance
Excuse my French, but I'm in France, haha, I'm just sayin'
Prince Williams ain't do it right, if you ask me
'Cause I was him, I would have married Kate and Ashley
What's Gucci, my nigga? What's Louis, my killer?
What's drugs, my dealer? What's that jacket, Margiela?
Doctors say I'm the illest 'cause I'm suffering from realness
Got my niggas in Paris and they going gorillas, huh
I don't even know what that means
No one knows what it means, but it's provocative
No, it's not, it's gross
Gets the people going

Ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna fine me
B-ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna fine me

You are now watching the throne
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
These other niggas is lyin'
Actin' like the summer ain't mine
(I got that hot bitch in my home)
You know how many hot bitches I own?
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
The stars is in the building
They hands is to the ceiling
I know I'm 'bout to kill it
How you know? I got that feeling
You are now watching the throne
Don't let me into my zone
Don't let me into my zone
(I'm definitely in my zone)"
40,The One That Got Away,Katy Perry,"Summer after high school, when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my eighteenth birthday, we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talked about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day, I'd be losing you

In another life
I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were
The one that got away
The one that got away

I was June, and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, woah
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse

But in another life
I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were
The one that got away
The one that got away

The one
The one
The one
The one that got away

All this money can't buy me a time machine, no
Can't replace you with a million rings, no
I should've told you what you meant to me, woah
'Cause now I pay the price

In another life
I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were
The one that got away
The one that got away (The one that got away)

The one (The one)
The one (The one)
The one (The one)
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were
The one that got away

41,Feel So Close,Calvin Harris,"I feel so close to you right now, it's a force field
I wear my heart upon my sleeve like a big deal
Your love pours down on me, surround me like a waterfall
And there's no stopping us right now

I feel so close to you right now, it's a force field

42,Someone like You,Adele,"I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead"

Rock my world until the sunlight
Make this dream the best I've ever known
Dirty dancin' in the moonlight
Take me down like I'm a domino
Every second is a highlight
When we touch, don't ever let me go
Dirty dancin' in the moonlight
Take me down like I'm a domino

You got me losin' my mind
My heart beats out of time
I'm seein' Hollywood stars
You strum me like a guitar

I can taste the tension like a cloud of smoke in the air
Now I'm breathin' like I'm runnin' 'cause you're takin' me there
Don't you know?
You spin me out of control

(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
We can do this all night
Damn, this love is skin tight
Baby, come on

Boom me like a bass drum
Sparkin' up a rhythm
Baby, come on

Rock my world until the sunlight
Make this dream the best I've ever known
Dirty dancin' in the moonlight
Take me down like I'm a domino
Every second is a highlight
When we touch, don't ever let me go
Dirty dancin' in the moonlight
Take me down like I'm a domino

Ooh baby, baby, got me feelin' so right
Ooh baby, baby, dancin' in the moonlight
Ooh baby, baby, got me feelin' so right
Ooh baby, baby, dancin' in the moonlight

50,Ass Back Home,Gym Class Heroes,"Oh, it's so sexy, yo

I don't know where you're going
Or when you're coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door (Ya)
For one more chance to hold you close
(It's your boy Travie, Gym Class Heroes)
I don't know where you're going (Let's go, yeah)
Just get your ass back home

We both knew this type of life didn't come with instructions (No)
So I'm trying to do my best to make something out of nothing
And sometimes it gets down right shitty in fact
When you call and I don't even know what city I'm at
Or what day of the week in the middle of the month
In a year I don't recall
It's like my life's on repeat and the last time we spoke I told you I wouldn't be long
That was last November, now December's almost gone
I'd apologize, but I don't realize what I'm doing wrong
I never know

I don't know where you're going
Or when you're coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door (That's love, yeah)
For one more chance to hold you close
I don't know where you're going (Uh-huh, okay, what's that?)
Just get your ass back home

And you've been nothing but amazing and I'll never take that for granted
Half of these birds would've flew the coop but you, you truly understand it
And the fact you stood beside me every time you heard some bogusness (Tough love)
You deserve a standing O cause they'd have just been over it
Let 'em talk, let 'em talk, let 'em talk, let 'em talk
Like we don't hear what they saying
Let 'em walk, let 'em walk, let 'em walk, let 'em walk
We'll just drive by and keep waving
'Cause you and I above all that, just let 'em wallow in it
And now they all choked up, yuck, 'cause they be swallowin' it

I don't know where you're going (Yeah)
Or when you're coming home (Alright)
I left the keys under the mat (I'm coming home, mama)
(Mama, I'm coming home)
To our front door (That's love)
For one more chance to hold you close
I don't know where you're going (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Just get your ass back home

No one holds me down like you do, sweetheart
You keep doing that, I'll keep doing this
And we'll be alright, trust that
We put the ""us"" in ""trust"", baby
Ahh, let's go!

I don't care what you're after
As long as I'm the one, no
I don't care why you're leaving
You'll miss me when you're gone

I don't know where you're going (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Or when you're coming home (Okay)
I left the keys under the mat (I'm home now, baby, let's go)
To our front door (Uh-huh)
For one more chance to hold you close
I don't know where you're going

And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever
And never let you forget it

Cottonwood fallin' like snow in July
Sunset, riverside, four wheel drives in a tail light circle
Roll down the windows, turn it on up
Pour a little crown in a dixie cup
Get the party started

Girl, you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mm-mm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money maker gotta be
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find
Hey, I'm a little drunk on you
And high on summertime

If you ain't a 10, you're a 9.9
Tippin' n' spillin' that home-made wine
On your tied up T-shirt
Every little kiss is drivin' me wild
Throwin' little cherry bombs into my fire
Good God almighty

Girl, you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mm-mm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money maker gotta be
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find
Hey, I'm a little drunk on you
And high on summertime

Let's slip on out where it's a little bit darker
And when it gets a little bit hotter
We'll take it off on out in the water

Girl, you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mm-mm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans

Chances are if she was acting up then I fucked her once and never fucked again
She could have a Grammy, I still treat her ass like a nominee
Just need to know what that pussy like so one time is fine with me
Young as an intern, but money like I built the shit

57,Springsteen,Eric Church,"To this day when I hear that song
I see you standin' there on that lawn
Discount shades, store bought tan
Flip flops and cut-off jeans
Somewhere between that setting sun
I'm on Fire and Born to Run
You looked at me and I was done
And we're, we're just getting started

I was singin' to you, you were singin' to me
I was so alive, never been more free
Fired up my daddy's lighter and we sang
Oohh
Stayed there 'til they forced us out
And took the long way to your house
I can still hear the sound of you sayin' ""don't go""

When I think about you, I think about 17
I think about my old Jeep
I think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like the soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen

I bumped into you by happenstance
You probably wouldn't even know who I am
But if I whispered your name I bet there'd still be a spark
Back when I was gasoline
And this old tattoo had brand new ink
And we didn't care what your mom would think
About your name on my arm

Baby, is it spring or is it summer?
The guitar sound or the beat of that drummer
You hear sometimes late at night
On your radio
Even though you're a million miles away
When you hear Born in the USA
You relive those glory days
So long ago

When you think about me, do you think about 17
Do you think about my old Jeep
Think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen

58,Brokenhearted,Karmin,"Oh, yeah
Uh, c'mon, yeah

This is more than the typical kinda thing
Felt a jones in my bones when you were touching me
Uh-oh, didn't wanna take it slow
In a daze, goin' craze, I can barely think
You're replayin' in my brain, find it hard to sleep
Uh-oh, waitin' for my phone to blow

Uh-oh, yup
Now I'm here in a sticky situation
Got a bit of trouble, yup, and now I'm pacin'
Five minutes, ten minutes, now it's been an hour
I don't wanna think too hard, but I'm sour
Uh-oh, I can't seem to let you go

See, I've been waitin' all day
For you to call me, baby
So let's get up, let's get on it
Don't you leave me brokenhearted tonight
Come on, that's right
Honest, baby, I'll do
Anything you want to
So can we finish what we started?
Don't you leave me brokenhearted tonight
Come on, that's right, cheerio

What's the time? Such a crime, not a single word
Sippin' on that Patrón just to calm my nerves
Uh-oh, poppin' bottles by the phone, oh yeah
Had me up, had me down, turned me inside out
That's enough, call me up, baby, I'm in doubt
Uh-oh, and I don't even think you know
No, no, no

See, I've been waitin' all day

So can we finish what we started?
Don't you leave me brokenhearted tonight
Come on, that's right, cheerio, ayy

Anything you wanna do, I'll be on it too
Everything you said is like gold with a view
Business in the front, party in the back
Maybe I was wrong, was the outfit really wack?
This kinda thing doesn't happen usually
I'm on the opposite side of it, truthfully
I know you want it, so come and get it
Cheerio

See, I've been waitin' all day
For you to call me, baby (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
So let's get up, let's get on it
Don't you leave me brokenhearted tonight (Oh-oh-whoa-oh, yeah)

Don't you leave me brokenhearted tonight (Hey!)

59,Not Over You,Gavin DeGraw,"Dreams; that's where I have to go
To see your beautiful face anymore
I stare at a picture of you and listen to the radio
Hope; hope there's a conversation
We both admit we had it good
But until then, it's alienation, I know
That much is understood
And I realize

If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
(You're not on my mind, you're not on my mind)
But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally, I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say, I'm not over you
Not over you (Not over you)

Damn, damn, girl, you do it well
And I thought you were innocent
Took this heart and put it through hell
But still, you're magnificent
I, I'm a boomerang, doesn't matter how you throw me
I turn around and I'm back in the game
Even better than the old me (Old me)
But I'm not even close without you

If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
(You're not on my mind, you're not on my mind)
But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally, I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say, I'm not over you

And if I had the chance to renew
You know there isn't a thing I wouldn't do
I could get back on the right track
But only if you'd be convinced
So until then

If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally, I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say, I'm not over you

Not over you (Not over you)
Not over you (Not over you)
Not over you (Not over you)"

My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no—
Oh—ote
Make me your radio (Yeah, ha)
And turn me up when you feel low (Turn it up a little bit)
This melody was meant for you (Right there)
To sing along to my stereo (Gym Class Heroes, baby!)

If I was just another dusty record on the shelf
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else?
If I asked you to scratch my back, could you manage that?
Like yikky-yeah check it, Travie, I can handle that
Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
I used to, used to, used to, used to, now I'm over that
'Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts

If I could only find a note to make you understand
I’d sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand
Just keep me stuck inside your head like your favorite tune
And know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you (Uh-ha-ha)

My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no— (Yeah)
Oh—ote (Yeah, yeah, come on)
Make me your radio (Huh-uh)

This melody was meant for you
To sing along to my stereo

Oh, oh oh-oh, oh
Oh oh-oh (To my stereo)
Oh, oh-oh, oh
To sing along to my stereo
Let's go!

If I was an old-school, fifty-pound boombox (Remember them?)
Would you hold me on your shoulder wherever you walk?
Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops? (Turn it up)
And crank it higher every time they told you to stop (Peace)
And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me
When you have to purchase mad D batteries
Appreciate every mixtape your friends make
You never know, we come and go like on the interstate (Never know)

I think I finally found a note to make you understand
If you could hit it, sing along and take me by the hand
Just keep me stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
You know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you (Uh-ha-ha)

My heart's a stereo (Yeah)
It beats for you, so listen close (Listen)
Hear my thoughts in every no—
Oh—ote (Oh, oh)
Make me your radio (Come on)
And turn me up when you feel low (Turn it up)
This melody was meant for you
To sing along to my stereo (Sing along like)

Oh, oh oh-oh, oh (Yeah)
Oh oh-oh (To my stereo)
Oh, oh-oh, oh
To sing along to my stereo (Sing along, sing along)

I only pray you never leave me behind (Never leave me)
Because good music can be so hard to find (So hard to find)
I'll take your hand and hold it closer to mine (Yeah)
Thought love was dead, but now you're changing my mind (Yeah, yeah, come on, ooh)

My heart's a stereo (Yeah)
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no—
Oh—ote (Oh, oh, oh)

62,Work Out,J. Cole,"I want to see you work out for me, work out for me

Ayy, we've got a good thing
Don’t know if I’ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl, I can’t be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain
You probably hoped it never would end
Like, “Is it the real thing
Or is it just a one-night stand?”
Well then

Let me see you get high, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)
High, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)

She like them boys with the big ol' chains
Ridin' around town in a big ol' Range
I knew her when I rocked big ol' jeans
Now the little nigga doin' big ol' thangs
Would you look at that? I came back for her
Just to give it to ya, like you asked for it
Man, that thing in them jeans too fat for her
Rebounds so I caught her off the backboard
I told her: “Baby girl, come here
Know I run the town even when I ain't from there.”
And I brag hardly, but just to show up at this party
I made what yo' nigga make in one year
That's unfair, but so is life, take a chance, roll the dice
Money can’t buy you love, 'cause it’s overpriced
Don’t overthink, just hope it's right
I’m only here for the night

Ayy, we've got a good thing
Don’t know if I’ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl, I can’t be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain
You probably hoped it never would end
Like, “Is it the real thing
Or is it just a one-night stand?”

Let me see you get high, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)

Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)

Carolina Blue kicks, fresh on the scene
Hottest nigga on the block
Damn, girl, you're mean
They be startin' shit, but it’s yo' world
On my Martin shit: “You go, girl!”
She bad and she know it
Some niggas save hoes, I’m not that heroic
Could you be my escort?
'Cause just like them two door Fords
Damn, they don’t make 'em like you no more
Cole World, real Cole World
Them boys cool—me, I’m on fire
Know what's on my mind
Tryna see what's on yours tonight, tonight, tonight
Move slow, 'cause you wanna live fast
Up late so you'll probably skip class
Life is a test so before the night pass, get right, get right

Ayy, we've got a good thing
Don’t know if I’ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl, I can’t be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain

Like, “Is it the real thing
Or is it just a one-night stand?”
Well then (Cole World)

Straight up, now tell me
Do you really wanna love me forever? (Oh oh oh)
Or is it just a hit-and-run?
(Well, hey) Straight up, I tell ya
I just really wanna cut when we together (Oh oh oh)
Come here, girl, let's get it on!

Haven't you heard the rumours? (Bless your soul)

Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds

Just 'cause I said it, don't mean that I meant it
Just 'cause you heard it

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
And the bullets catch in her teeth

Life goes on, it gets so heavy
The wheel breaks the butterfly
Every tear, a waterfall
In the night, the stormy night, she'd close her eyes
In the night, the stormy night, away she'd fly

And dream of para-, para-, paradise
Para-, para-, paradise
Para-, para-, paradise
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
She'd dream of para-, para-, paradise
Para-, para-, paradise
Para-, para-, paradise
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

La, la-la, la-la-la
La, la-la, la-la-la
La, la-la, la-la-la, la-la
So lying underneath those stormy skies
She said, ""Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, I know the sun must set to rise""

This could be para-, para-, paradise
Para-, para-, paradise
This could be para-, para-, paradise
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
This could be para-, para-paradise
Para-, para-, paradise
This could be para-, para-, paradise
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh


This could be para-, para-, paradise
This could be para-, para-, paradise
This could be para-, para-, paradise
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh"
69,Blown Away,Carrie Underwood,"Dry lightning cracks across the skies
Those storm clouds gather in her eyes
Her daddy was a mean old mister
Mama was an angel in the ground
The weatherman called for a twister
She prayed blow it down

There's not enough rain in Oklahoma
To wash the sins out of that house
There's not enough wind in Oklahoma
To rip the nails out of the past

Shatter every window 'til it's all blown away
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away
'Til there's nothing left standing, nothing left of yesterday
Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away
Blown away (Blown away)

She heard those sirens screamin' out
Her daddy laid there, passed out on the couch
She locked herself in the cellar
Listened to the screamin' of the wind
Some people called it taking shelter
She called it sweet revenge

Shatter every window 'til it’s all blown away
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away
'Til there's nothing left standing, nothing left of yesterday
Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away
Blown away

There’s not enough rain in Oklahoma
To wash the sins out of that house
There’s not enough wind in Oklahoma
To rip the nails out of the past (Blown away)

Shatter every window 'til it’s all blown away
Every brick, every board, every slamming door blown away
'Til there's nothing left standing, nothing left of yesterday
Every tear-soaked whiskey memory blown away
Blown away

Blown away
Blown away
Blown away
Blown away"
70,Rolling in the Deep,Adele,"There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

We could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you, now I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared

(You're gonna wish you never had met me) The scars of your love remind me of us
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me) The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) I can't help feeling

We could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
Could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it with a beating

Throw your soul through every open door (Ooh woah, oh)
Count your blessings to find what you look for (Woah)
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (Ooh woah, oh)
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you've sown

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
We could've had it all (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could've had it all, yeah (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
It all, it all, it all (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
Could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
But you played it, you played it, you played it
You played it to the beat"

I turn the TV off, to turn it on again
Staring at the blades of the fan as it spins around
Counting every crack, the clock is wide awake
Talking to myself, anything to make a sound
{Chorus}
I told you I wouldn’t call, I told you I wouldn’t care
But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere
I don’t think that I can take this bed getting any colder
Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over
{Verse 2}
You can say we’re done the way you always do
It’s easier to lie to me than to yourself
Forget about your friends, you know they’re gonna say
We’re bad for each other, but we ain’t good for anyone else
{Chorus}
I told you I wouldn’t call, I told you I wouldn’t care
But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere
I don’t think that I can take this bed getting any colder
Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over
{Bridge}
We don’t have to miss each other, come over
We don’t have to fix each other, come over
We don’t have to say forever, come over
You don’t have to stay forever, come over

{Chorus}
I told you I wouldn’t call, I told you I wouldn’t care
But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere
I don’t think that I can take this bed getting any colder
Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over

Woop, turn the lights on
Oh woah, oh woah

We share somethin' so common, but still so rare
And I'm in awe, never been here before
So high, we're still climbin', even here inside these walls
Breakin' each others hearts and we don't care 'cause we're so

In too deep, can't think about givin' it up
But I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack
It's killin' me, swear I never cried so much
'Cause I never knew love would hurt this fuckin' bad
The worst pain that I ever had (Turn the lights on)
Oh woah, never knew love, oh woah
Would hurt this fuckin' bad
The worst pain that I ever had

All the times when I know I should be smilin'
Seem to be the time that I frown the most
Can't believe that we're still survivin'
'Cause I'm slowly breakin' down even when I hold you close
And if I lose you, I'm afraid I would lose who
Who I gave my love to
That's the reason I stay around
Even though I fell way

In too deep, can't think about givin' it up
But I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack
It's killin' me, swear I never cried so much
'Cause I never knew love would hurt this fuckin' bad
The worst pain that I ever had (Turn the lights on)
Oh woah, never knew love, oh woah
Would hurt this fuckin' bad
The worst pain that I ever had

And it hurts 'cause I wanna leave
And you wanna leave, but the love keeps us together
And if I lose you, I'm afraid I would lose who, who I gave my love to
That's the reason I stay around, even though I fell way

In too deep, can't think about givin' it up
But I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack
It's killin' me, swear I never cried so much
'Cause I never knew love would hurt this fuckin' bad
The worst pain that I ever had (Turn the lights on)
Oh woah, never knew love, oh woah
Would hurt this fuckin' bad
The worst pain that I ever had"

Grip the grain, roll up

I don't ride the toll, don't pay the change

She cookin' dinner with your pans
Draped up, dripped out

Want somebody that don't really need you

Same hood, same style, same drink, same cup

I never call, she knows what's up
Same page, same book, different song, same hook
Everytime her nigga trippin', she on the phone with the same crook
And everytime I pull up, she hit me with that same look
Lips bitin', hips right
She left her man for that get right
I'm in the middle, like midnight

Only if you got that wine fine
Only if you got that sip type

Drinking a German beer, with a Cuban cigar
In the middle of Paris with a Dominican broad
Great head on her shoulders, she probably studied abroad
She transferred to Harvard from King's College in March
She says that I'm her favorite 'cause she admires the art
Michelangelo with the flow, Picasso with the bars
She's well put together like a piece by Gershwin
Renaissance style, tonight is picture perfect, so smile

And pack your bags real good, baby
'Cause you'll be gone for a while, while, while

Girl, tell me how you feel, what's your fantasy oh
I see us on a beach down in Mexico
You can put your feet up, be my señorita
We ain't gotta rush, just take it slow
You'll be in the high life, soaking up the sunlight
Anything you want is yours
I'll have you living life like you should
You'll say you never had it so good

La, la la, la la, la la, la, la la
You never had it so good
La, la la, la la, la la, la, la la

Suffering from first class cabin fever
Five hour layovers from Norway to Egypt
I'm to the point like the pyramids of Giza
Still I'm to the left like the tower out in Pisa
I'm feeling single baby, I could use a feature
Swagger like Caesar, I'll get you a visa
We can go to Italy and maybe see the Colosseum
I'll be Da Vinci if you'll be my Mona Lisa, now smile

So pack your bags real good, baby

Well I been feeling singular, how 'bout let's make it plural
Spin the globe, wherever it lands that's where we'll go
We'll hit up Europe, yep, and spend some Euros
And maybe visit Berlin, the walls with the murals
This is your month baby, sign of the Virgo
Private reservations, glasses full of Merlot
A Rosé, a Burgundy, traveling like turbo
Brush up on your Español, we're Barcelona-bound, so smile

So pack your bags real good, baby

My heart is paralyzed
My head was oversized
I'll take the high road like I should
You said it's meant to be
That it's not you, it's me
You're leaving now for my own good

That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are, I'm gonna say

She went down in an airplane
Fried getting suntanned
Fell in a cement mixer full of quicksand
Help me, help me, I'm no good at goodbyes
She met a shark under water
Fell and no one caught her
I returned everything I ever bought her
Help me, help me, I'm all out of lies
And ways to say you died

My pride still feels the sting
You were my everything
Some day I'll find a love like yours (a love like yours)
She'll think I'm Superman
Not super minivan
How could you leave on Yom Kippur?

That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are, I'm gonna say

She was caught in a mudslide
Eaten by a lion
Got run over by a crappy purple Scion
Help me, help me, I'm no good at goodbyes
She dried up in the desert
Drowned in a hot tub
Danced to death at an east side night club
Help me, help me, I'm all out of lies
And ways to say you died

I wanna live a thousand lives with you
I wanna be the one you're dying to love
But you don't want to

That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are, I'm gonna say
That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are, I'm gonna say

She went down in an airplane
Fried getting suntanned
Fell in a cement mixer full of quicksand
Help me, help me, I'm no good at goodbyes
She met a shark under water
Fell and no one caught her
I returned everything I ever bought her
Help me, help me, I'm all out of lies

She was caught in a mudslide
Eaten by a lion
Got run over by a crappy purple Scion
Help me, help me, I'm no good at goodbyes
She dried up in the desert
Drowned in a hot tub
Danced to death at an east side night club
Help me, help me, I'm all out of lies
And ways to say you died"
81,Red Solo Cup,Toby Keith,"25 ContributorsRed Solo Cup Lyrics
One, two, a one, two, three

Now, red Solo cup is the best receptacle
For barbecues, tailgates, fairs, and festivals
And you, sir, do not have a pair of testicles
If you prefer drinking from glass
Hey, red Solo cup is cheap and disposable
In 14 years, they are decomposable
And unlike my home, they are not foreclosable
Freddy Mac can kiss my ass
Whoo!

Red Solo cup
I fill you up
Let's have a party
Let's have a party
I love you, red Solo cup
I lift you up
Proceed to party
Proceed to party

Now, I really love how you're easy to stack
But I really hate how you're easy to crack
'Cause when beer runs down the front of my back
Well, that, my friends, is quite yucky
But I have to admit that the ladies get smitten
Admiring at how sharply my first name is written
On you with a Sharpie when I get to hittin'
On them to help me get lucky

Red Solo cup
I fill you up
Let's have a party
Let's have a party
I love you, red Solo cup (What?)
I lift you up
Proceed to party
Proceed to party (Proceed to party)

Now, I've seen you in blue and I've seen you in yellow
But only you, red, will do for this fellow
'Cause you are the Abbott to my Costello
And you are the Fruit to my Loom (Here we go now)
Red Solo cup, you're more than just plastic
You're more than amazing, you're more than fantastic
And believe me that I'm not the least bit sarcastic
When I look at you and say

Red Solo cup, you're not just a cup
(No! No! No! God, no! )
You're my-you're my (Friend?) friend
(Friend, friend, friend, life-long)
Thank you for being my friend

Red Solo cup
(That's what I am talking about)
I fill you up
Let's have a party
(Let's have a party)
Let's have a party
(Let's have a party)
I love you, red Solo cup
I lift you up
Proceed to party
Proceed to party
Red Solo cup
Red Solo
(I fill you up, let's have a party)
Let's have a party
(Let's have a party)
Let's have a party
(Red Solo cup)
Oh red Solo cup
(I lift you up)
Let's have a party
Proceed to party, yeah, yeah

(Solo cup, solo cup, solo cup)
(Solo cup, solo cup, solo cup)
(Solo cup, solo cup)"

I hear your heartbeat to the beat of the drums

85,5 O'Clock,T-Pain,"It's 5 o' clock in the morning
Conversation got boring
You said you'd go in to bed soon
So I snuck off to your bedroom
And I thought I'd just wait there (Ugh)
Until I heard you come up the stairs (Ugh)
And I pretended I was sleeping (Ugh)
And I was hoping you would— (Ayy)

It's 5 o'clock in the morning, and I want ya
And you want me, don't ya?
I can see it, 'cause you've been waiting on me
Since I said that I was hitting in the club
The Sun be coming up on me
And I know you be getting so horny (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
'Cause you be sending me texts-es
Like, ""Boy, just get your ass up in that car
And come get all of this love""
(It's 5 o'clock in the morning) You ain't got to remind me
She already said if I don't come on time, she—
Might go crazy
And she'll be waiting on me naked with one of my chains on
She might come and find me (Ah-ah-ah)
And then ask me kindly— (Ah-ah-ah)
Do I want her to go crazy? We do this every night
And then, we always wake up singing the same song

It's 5 o' clock in the morning (Yeah)
Conversation got boring (Talk to me, girl)
You said you'd go in to bed soon (Let's go)
So I snuck off to your bedroom (Come on)
And I thought I'd just wait there (Wait on me)

And I pretended I was sleeping (All right)
And I was hoping you would creep in (Goodnight)

You said you'd go in to bed soon
So I snuck off to your bedroom
And I thought I'd just wait there
Until I heard you come up the stairs
And I pretended I was sleeping (Oh, oh-oh)
And I was hoping you would creep in

It's 5 o'clock in the morning, and you calling
And these females got me stalling
I can hear your voice in my head, like
""What is he doing?"" (Oh) ""What is he doing?""
'Cause I keep checking my cell phone and these missed calls
And you texting me, like, ""I'ma kill y'all
If you don't get your ass up out of that club
And do you know what time it is?""
(It's 5 o'clock in the morning) Ooh (Ooh)
Well, my bad, girl
And this Nuvo got me tripping, and I know that you mad, girl
But you ain't got to worry about nothing (Worry 'bout nothing)
Girl, I got you (I got you), girl I got you
She might come and find me-ee (Nah-nah-nah)
And then ask me kindly-y (Oh, no, no)

And I pretended I was sleeping (Oh, oh-oh)
And I was hoping you would creep in

Oh-oh, and you ain't got nothing on
But the T-shirt that I left over your house the last time I came and put it on ya
Too many thirsty girls up in this club for me to leave here with one of them—that's why I call her
And you'll be right at home, waiting for me
IPhone plugged in the wall, just waiting for me
Club closed at 6, left around 4:30
Yeah, so by the time I'm at your crib—
(It’s 5 o' clock in the morning) And you yawning
But I’ve been drinking all night, and I feel like performing
With you in the bedroom, floor to the dresser
Dont want nothing less 'cause I’m sure you’re the best, you’re the one
So I let you—that's how you show me love
And when we finished, you like, “Damn, babe, you woke me up” (Whoa, oh)
I like you way you put it down, like it's for both of us (Oh, oh)
The sun ain't the only thing that's coming up (Oh, yeah)

It's 5 o' clock in the morning (Hahahahaha)
The conversation got boring
You said you'd go in to bed soon

86,A Thousand Years,Christina Perri,"155 ContributorsTranslationsΕλληνικάالعربيةDeutschTürkçeA Thousand Years Lyrics“A Thousand Years” is about an eternal love. It was written by Christina Perri, specifically for The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 1 soundtrack.
Heart beats fast, colors and promises
How to be brave? How can I love when I'm afraid to fall?
But watching you stand alone
All of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow

One step closer

I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

Time stands still, beauty in all she is
I will be brave, I will not let anything take away
What's standing in front of me
Every breath, every hour has come to this

One step closer

I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
And all along, I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more


One step closer
One step closer

I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
And all along, I believed I would find you
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more"

Been going 'round and 'round all day
Bailing some hay and stackin' it all up
Can't wait for the sun to go down
Roll into town, shine the old truck up
Swing by the Quick Stop
Grab a couple rocky tops
Then ease on out your way
To your place around eight o'clock

Well, I'm just ready to ride this Chevy
Ride this Chevy down a little back road
Slide your pretty little self on over
Get a little closer, turn up the radio
Put your pretty pink toes on the dash
Lean the seat back
Man, I swear there ain't nothin' looks better than that
Sweet tan little thing with nothin' to do
I wanna take a little ride with you

I hope you're wearing those frayed out cut-offs
Makes me want to get lost out in the moonlight
Drop the tailgate down on a turn road
Watch the corn grow, baby, that's a good night
Anyone from the heartland is gonna understand
What I am talking about right now
Ain't no doubt, we got a game plan

Well, I'm just ready to ride this Chevy
Ride this Chevy down a little back road
Slide your pretty little self on over
Get a little closer, turn up the radio
Put your pretty pink toes on the dash
Lean the seat back
Man, I swear there ain't nothin' looks better than that
Sweet tan little thing with nothin' to do
I wanna take a little ride with you


Well, I'm just ready to ride this Chevy
Ride this Chevy down a little back road
Slide your pretty little self on over
Get a little closer, you can play my radio
Put your pretty pink toes on the dash
Lean the seat back
Man, I swear there ain't nothin' looks better than that
Sweet tan little thing with nothin' to do
I wanna take a little ride with you

Take a little ride with you

90,It's Time,Imagine Dragons,"So this is what you meant
When you said that you were spent
And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit
Right to the top
Don't hold back
Packing my bags and giving the academy a rain check

I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand?
That I'm never changing who I am

So this is where you fell
And I am left to sell
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell
Right to the top
Don't look back
Turn in the rags and giving the commodities a rain check

I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand?
That I'm never changing who I am
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand?
That I'm never changing who I am

This road never looked so lonely
This house doesn't burn down slowly
To ashes, to ashes

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand?
That I'm never changing who I am

92,I Don't Want This Night to End,Luke Bryan,"20 ContributorsI Don’t Want This Night to End Lyrics
Girl, I know I don't know you
But your pretty little eyes so blue
Are pullin' me in
Like the moon on your skin
I'm so glad you trusted me
To slide up on this dusty seat
And let your hair down
And get out of town

Got the stars comin' out over my hood
And all I know now is it's going good

You got your hands up
You're rockin' in my truck
You got the radio on
You're singin' every song
I'm set on cruise control
I'm slowly losin' hold
Of everything I've got
You're looking so damn hot

And I don't know what road we're on
Or where we've been
From starin' at you, girl
All I know is I don't want this night to end

Gonna cuss the mornin' when it comes
'Cause I know that the risin' sun
Ain’t no good for me
'Cause you'll have to leave
Gonna make the most of every mile
Do anything to make your smile
Land on my lips
Get drunk on your kiss

Clock on the dash says 3:35
There's plenty of gas, and the night's still alive

You got your hands up
You’re rockin' in my truck
You got the radio on
You're singin' every song
I'm set on cruise control
I'm slowly losin' hold
Of everything I've got
You're looking so damn hot

And I don't know what road we're on
Or where we've been
From starin' at you, girl
All I know is I don't want this night to end


You got your hands up
You're rockin' in my truck
You got the radio on
You're singin' every song
I'm set on cruise control
I'm slowly losin' hold
Of everything I've got
You're looking so damn hot

And I don't know what road we're on
Or where we've been
From starin' at you, girl
All I know is I don't want this night to end

I don't want this night to end
No, I don’t want this night to end"

94,Hard to Love,Lee Brice,"17 ContributorsHard To Love Lyrics
I am insensitive, I have a tendency to
Pay more attention to the things that I need
Sometimes I drink too much, sometimes I test your trust
Sometimes I don't know why you're staying with me

I'm hard to love, hard to love,  no I don't make it easy
Well I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love, hard to love, and you say that you need me
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me good

I am a short fuse, I am a wrecking ball
Crashing into your heart like I do
You're like a Sunday morning, full of grace and full of Jesus
I wish that I could be more like you

I'm hard to love, hard to love, no I don't make it easy
Well I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love, hard to love and you say that you need me
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me good
Love me good

Girl you've given me a million second chances
And I don't ever wanna take you for granted
I'm just a man, I'm just a man

Hard to love, hard to love, no I don't make it easy
I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love, hard to love and you say that you need me
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me
Hard to love, hard to love, no I don't make it easy
I couldn't do it if I stood where you stood
I'm hard to love, hard to love and you say that you need me
I don't deserve it but I love that you love me
Good

You love me good"
95,Somethin' 'Bout a Truck,Kip Moore,"12 ContributorsSomethin’ ’Bout a Truck Lyrics
There's somethin' 'bout a truck in a farmer's field
A ""No trespass"" sign, and time to kill
Nobody's gonna get hurt, so what's the big deal?
There's somethin' 'bout a truck in a farmer's field

And there's somethin' 'bout beer sitting on ice
After a long hard day, makes it taste just right
On that dropped tailgate on a summer night
There's somethin' 'bout beer sittin' on ice

And there's somethin' 'bout a girl in a red sundress
With an ice cold beer pressed against her lips
In that farmer's field (Hah), will make a boy a mess
There's somethin' 'bout a girl in a red sundress

And there's somethin' bout a kiss that's gonna lead to more
On that dropped tailgate, back behind the corn
The most natural thing you've ever felt before
There's somethin' 'bout a kiss that's gonna lead to more

And there's somethin' 'bout a truck in a field
And a girl in a red sundress with an ice cold beer to her lips
Begging for another kiss
And there's somethin' 'bout you and me and the birds and the bees
And Lord have mercy, it's a beautiful thing
Ain't nothing 'bout it luck, there's somethin' 'bout a truck

There's somethin' 'bout a creek around 2 AM
After a few of those beers, you wanna dive on in
You don't need no clothes, so just hang 'em on a limb
There's somethin' 'bout a creek around 2 AM

And there's somethin' 'bout a truck in a field
And a girl in a red sundress with an ice cold beer to her lips
Begging for another kiss
And there's somethin' 'bout you and me and the birds and the bees
And Lord have mercy it's a beautiful thing
Ain't nothing 'bout it luck, there's somethin' 'bout a truck
Ain't nothing 'bout it luck, there's somethin' 'bout a truck
Hah"

97,Fly Over States,Jason Aldean,"19 ContributorsFly Over States Lyrics
A couple of guys in first class on a flight
From New York to Los Angeles
Kinda making small talk killing time
Flirting with the flight attendants
Thirty-thousand feet above, could be Oklahoma

Just a bunch of square cornfields and wheat farms
Man, it all looks the same
Miles and miles of back roads and highways
Connecting little towns with funny names
Who'd want to live down there in the middle of nowhere?

They've never drove through Indiana
Met the men who plowed that earth
Planted that seed, busted his ass for you and me
Or caught a harvest moon in Kansas
They'd understand why God made
Those flyover states

I bet that mile long Santa Fe freight train engineer's seen it all
Just like that flatbed cowboy stacking US steel on a 3-day haul
Roads and rails under their feet
Yeah that sounds like a first class seat

On the plains of Oklahoma
With a windshield sunset in your eyes
Like a water-colored painted sky
You'll think heaven's doors have opened
You'll understand why God made
Those flyover states

Take a ride across the badlands
Feel that freedom on your face
Breathe in all that open space
And meet a girl from Amarillo
You'll understand why God made
You might even wanna plant your stakes
In those flyover states
(Yeah)

Have you ever been through Indiana?
On the plains of Oklahoma?
Take a ride"
98,Even If It Breaks Your Heart,Eli Young Band,"19 ContributorsEven If It Breaks Your Heart Lyrics
Way back on the radio dial
The fire got lit inside a bright-eyed child
Every note just wrapped around his soul
From steel guitars to Memphis, all the way to rock and roll

Oh, I can hear 'em playin'
I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol' guitar
Oh, I can hear 'em singin'
""Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart""

Downtown is where I used to wander
Old enough to get there, but too young to get inside
So I would stand out on the sidewalk
Listen to the music playin' every Friday night

Oh, I can hear 'em playin'
I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol' guitar
Oh, I can hear 'em singin'
""Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart""

Some dreams stay with you forever
Drag you around but bring you back to where you were
Some dreams keep on gettin' better
You gotta keep believin' if you wanna know for sure

Oh, I can hear 'em playin'
I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol' guitar
Oh, I can hear 'em singin'
""Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart""
Oh, I can hear 'em playin'
I can hear the ringin' of a beat up ol' guitar
Oh, I can hear 'em singin'
""Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart""
""Keep on dreamin', even if it breaks your heart""

Keep on dreamin'
Don't let it break your heart"
99,Burn It Down,Linkin Park,"The cycle repeated
As explosions broke in the sky
All that I needed
Was the one thing I couldn't find

And you were there at the turn
Waiting to let me know

We're building it up
To break it back down
We're building it up
To burn it down
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

The colors conflicted
As the flames climbed into the clouds
I wanted to fix this
But couldn't stop from tearing it down

And you were there at the turn
Caught in the burning glow
And I was there at the turn
Waiting to let you know

We're building it up
To break it back down
We're building it up
To burn it down
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

You told me yes, you held me high
And I believed when you told that lie
I played soldier, you played king
And struck me down when I kissed that ring
You lost that right to hold that crown
I built you up but you let me down
So when you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn (Burn)

And you were there at the turn
Waiting to let me know

We're building it up
To break it back down
We're building it up
To burn it down
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

When you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn (Burn)
We can't wait to burn it to the ground
When you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn (Burn)

Walk into the club like, ""What up? I got a big cock""
Nah, I'm just pumped, I bought some shit from a thrift shop
Ice on the fringe is so damn frosty
The people like, ""Damn, that's a cold-ass honkey""
Rollin' in hella deep, headed to the mezzanine
Dressed in all pink 'cept my gator shoes, those are green
Draped in a leopard mink, girl standin' next to me
Probably should've washed this, smells like R. Kelly sheets
Piss
But shit, it was ninety-nine cents (Bag it)
Coppin' it, washin' it, 'bout to go and get some compliments
Passin' up on those moccasins someone else has been walkin' in

And saving my money and I'm hella happy, that's a bargain, bitch
I'ma take your grandpa's style, I'ma take your grandpa's style
No, for real, ask your grandpa, can I have his hand-me-downs? (Thank you)
Velour jumpsuit and some house slippers
Dookie-brown leather jacket that I found diggin'
They had a broken keyboard, I bought a broken keyboard
I bought a skeet blanket, then I bought a knee board
Hello, hello, my ace man, my mellow
John Wayne ain't got nothing on my fringe game, hell no
I could take some Pro Wings, make 'em cool, sell those
The sneaker heads would be like, ""Ah, he got the Velcros""

Limited edition, let's do some simple addition
Fifty dollars for a T-shirt, that's just some ignorant bitch shit
I call that getting-swindled-and-pimped shit
I call that getting tricked by business
That shirt's hella dope

Keep your eyes on me
Baby, keep your eyes on me

'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now (You show me, baby)
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along

It's like you're my mirror (Oh)
My mirror's staring back at me (Oh)
I couldn't get any bigger (Oh)
With anyone else beside me (Oh)
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making
Two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror (Oh)
My mirror's staring back at me, staring back at me

And I just wanna see your face light up since you put me on
So now I say goodbye to the old me, it's already gone
And I can't wait, wait, wait, wait, wait to get you home
Just to let you know, you are

106,Just Give Me a Reason,Pink,"Right from the start
You were a thief, you stole my heart
And I, your willing victim
I let you see the parts of me
That weren't all that pretty
And with every touch, you fixed them

Now you've been talkin' in your sleep, oh, oh
Things you never say to me, oh, oh
Tell me that you've had enough of our love, our love

Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second, we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
We're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again

I'm sorry I don't understand
Where all of this is coming from
I thought that we were fine
(Oh, we had everything)
Your head is running wild again
My dear, we still have everythin'
And it's all in your mind
(Yeah, but this is happenin')

You've been havin' real bad dreams, oh, oh
You used to lie so close to me, oh, oh
There's nothin' more than empty sheets between our love, our love
Oh, our love, our love, love

Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second, we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
I never stopped
You're still written in the scars on my heart
You're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again

Oh, tears ducts and rust
I'll fix it for us
We're collectin' dust
But our love's enough
You're holdin' it in
You're pourin' a drink
No, nothin' is as bad as it seems
We'll come clean

Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second, we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
That we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
Just give me a reason

107,When I Was Your Man,Bruno Mars,"Same bed, but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio, but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name

It all just sounds like (Ooh, ooh)
Mm, too young, too dumb to realize

That I should've bought you flowers
And held your hand
Shoulda gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancin'
But she's dancin' with another man

Uh, my pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
Caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made, oh
And that haunts me every time I close my eyes

It all just sounds like (Ooh, ooh)
Mm, too young, too dumb to realize

That I should've bought you flowers
And held your hand
Shoulda gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancin'
But she's dancin' with another man

Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say that
I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know

I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
When he has the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause I remember how much you love to dance
Do all the things I should've done
When I was your man
Do all the things I should've done
When I was your man"
108,Cruise,Florida Georgia Line,"Baby, you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Ayy, baby

Yeah, when I first saw that bikini top on her
She’s poppin' right out of the South Georgia water
Thought, ""Oh, good lord,"" she had them long tanned legs
Couldn't help myself, so I walked up and said

Well, baby, you a song, you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road, blowin' stop signs through the middle every little farm town with you
And this brand new Chevy with a lift kit would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it, heh
So, baby, you a song, you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

Well, she was sippin' on Southern and singin' Marshall Tucker
We were fallin' in love in the sweet heart of summer
She hopped right up into the cab of my truck and said
""Fire it up, let's go get this thing stuck""

Baby, you a song, you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road, blowin' stop signs through the middle every little farm town with you
And this brand new Chevy with a lift kit would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it, heh
So, baby, you a song, you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

When that summer sun fell to his knees
I looked at her and she looked at me
And I turned on those KC lights and drove all night
Because it felt so right, her and I, man, we felt so right

I put it in park and grabbed my guitar
And strummed a couple chords
And sang from the heart
Girl, you sure got the beat in my chest bumpin'
Hell, I can't get you out of my head

Baby, you a song, you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise (Hahaha)
Down a back road, blowin' stop signs through the middle every little farm town with you

Well, baby, you a song, you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road, blowin' stop signs through the middle every little farm town with you
And this brand new Chevy with a lift kit would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it, come on
Baby, you a song, you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

Come on, girl
Get those windows down and cruise
Aw, yeah"
109,Roar,Katy Perry,"I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sat quietly, agreed politely
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point

You held me down, but I got up (Hey)
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up (Hey)
Get ready 'cause I've had enough

'Round and around and around and around, we go
Oh, now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know

Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay
It's not much of a life you're living
It's not just something you take, it's given

'Round and around and around and around, we go

Ooh

Well, funny you're the broken one
But I'm the only one who needed saving
'Cause when you never see the light
It's hard to know which one of us is caving

117,Wrecking Ball,Miley Cyrus,"We clawed, we chained our hearts in vain
We jumped, never asking why
We kissed, I fell under your spell
A love no one could deny
Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you

I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me

I put you high up in the sky
And now, you're not coming down
It slowly turned, you let me burn
And now, we're ashes on the ground
Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you

I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Left me crashing in a blazing fall
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me

I never meant to start a war
I just wanted you to let me in
And instead of using force
I guess I should've let you win
I never meant to start a war
I just wanted you to let me in
I guess I should've let you win

Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you

I came in like a wrecking ball

118,Wake Me Up,Avicii,"Feelin' my way through the darkness
Guided by a beatin' heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well, life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well, that's fine by me

So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time, I was findin' myself and I
Didn't know﻿ I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time, I was findin' myself and I
Didn't know﻿ I was lost



I tried carryin' the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
Hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game﻿ made for everyone
And love is the prize

So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time, I was findin' myself and I
Didn't know﻿ I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time, I was findin' myself and I
I didn't know I was lost

Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

You and I go hard at each other like we're going to war
You and I go rough, we keep throwing things and slamming the doors
You and I get so damn dysfunctional, we stopped keeping score
You and I get sick, yeah, I know that we can't do this no more

Yeah but baby, there you go again, there you go again
Making me love you
Yeah, I stopped using my head, using my head
Let it all go
Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo
And now I'm feeling stupid, feeling stupid crawling back to you

So I cross my heart, and I hope to die
That I'll only stay with you one more night
And I know I've said it a million times
But I'll only stay with you one more night

Try to tell you ""no,"" but my body keeps on telling you ""yes""
Try to tell you ""stop,"" but your lipstick got me so out of breath
I'll be waking up in the morning, probably hating myself
And I'll be waking up, feeling satisfied, but guilty as hell

Yeah but baby, there you go again, there you go again
Making me love you (Making me love you)
Yeah, I stopped using my head, using my head
Let it all go (Let it all go)
Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo (Like a tattoo, yeah)

So I cross my heart, and I hope to die (Yeah)

B-B-Be careful making wishes in the dark, dark
Can't be sure when they've hit their mark
And besides in the mean-meantime, I'm just
Dreaming of tearin' you apart
I'm in the deep details with the Devil
You know, the world can never get me on my level
I just gotta get you out the cage
I'm a young lover's rage
Gonna need a spark to ignite

But my songs know what you did in the dark

So light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
I'm on fire

Well all the writers keep writing what they write
Somewhere another pretty vein just died (Died)
I've got the scars from tomorrow and I wish you could see
That you're the antidote to everything except for me
Through a constellation of tears on your lashes
Burn everything you love, then burn the ashes
In the end everything collides, my childhood
Spat back out the monster that you see

My songs know what you did in the dark

So light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
I'm on fire
So light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up

142,Same Love,Macklemore & Ryan Lewis,"When I was in the third grade, I thought that I was gay
'Cause I could draw, my uncle was, and I kept my room straight
I told my mom, tears rushing down my face
She's like, ""Ben, you've loved girls since before Pre-K""
Trippin', yeah, I guess she had a point, didn't she?
A bunch of stereotypes all in my head
I remember doing the math like, ""Yeah, I'm good at little league""
A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant
For those that like the same sex had the characteristics
The right-wing conservatives think it's a decision
And you can be cured with some treatment and religion
Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition
Playing God, aw nah, here we go
America the brave still fears what we don't know
And ""God loves all his children"" is somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book written thirty-five hundred years ago
I don't know
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

If I was gay, I would think hip-hop hates me
Have you read the YouTube comments lately?
""Man, that's gay"" gets dropped on the daily
We've become so numb to what we're sayin'
Our culture founded from oppression
Yet we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board
A word rooted in hate, yet our genre still ignores it
And ""gay"" is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender to skin color, the complexion of your pigment
The same fight that led people to walk-outs and sit-ins
It's human rights for everybody, there is no difference
Live on and be yourself
When I was at church they taught me something else
If you preach hate at the service, those words aren't anointed
That holy water that you soak in has been poisoned
When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless
Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen
I might not be the same, but that's not important
No freedom 'til we're equal, damn right I support it

And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

We press play, don't press pause, progress, march on
With a veil over our eyes, we turn our back on the cause
'Til the day that my uncles can be united by law
When kids are walking 'round the hallway
Plagued by a pain in their heart
A world so hateful, some would rather die than be who they are
And a certificate on paper isn't gonna solve it all
But it's a damn good place to start
No law's gonna change us, we have to change us
Whatever god you believe in, we come from the same one
Strip away the fear, underneath it's all the same love
About time that we raised up, sing
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

Love is patient
Love is kind
Love is patient
Love is kind (Not crying on Sundays)
Love is patient (Not crying on Sundays)
Love is kind (I'm not crying on Sundays)
Love is patient (Not crying on Sundays)
Love is kind (I'm not crying on Sundays)
Love is patient (Not crying on Sundays)
Love is kind (I'm not crying on Sundays)
Love is patient
Love is kind"
143,Sweet Nothing,Calvin Harris,"42 ContributorsSweet Nothing Lyrics
You took my heart and you held it in your mouth
And with a word, all my love came rushin' out
And every whisper, it's the worst
Emptied out by a single word
There is a hollow in me now

So I'll put my faith in somethin' unknown
I'm livin' on such sweet nothin'
But I'm tired of hope with nothin' to hold
I'm livin' on such sweet nothin'
And it's hard to learn, and it's hard to love
When you're givin' me such sweet nothin'
Sweet nothin', sweet nothin'
You're givin' me such sweet nothin'


It isn't easy for me to let it go
'Cause I've swallowed every single word
And every whisper, every sigh
Eats away at this heart of mine
And there is a hollow in me now

So I'll put my faith in somethin' unknown
I'm livin' on such sweet nothin'
But I'm tired of hope with nothin' to hold
I'm livin' on such sweet nothin'
And it's hard to learn, and it's hard to love
When you're givin' me such sweet nothin'
Sweet nothin', sweet nothin'
You're givin' me such sweet nothin'


And it's not enough to tell me that you care
When we both know the words are empty air
You give me nothing (Woah, woah, woah)
Nothing

Woah, woah, woah, sweet nothin' (Woah)
Woah, woah, woah, sweet nothin' (Woah)"
144,Summertime Sadness,Lana Del Rey,"Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you the best

I got my red dress on tonight
Dancin' in the dark, in the pale moonlight
Done my hair up real big, beauty queen style
High heels off, I'm feelin' alive

Oh my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore (One, two, three, four)

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you the best

I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh, oh

I'm feelin' electric tonight
Cruisin' down the coast, goin' 'bout 99
Got my bad baby by my heavenly side
I know, if I go, I'll die happy tonight

Oh my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore (One, two, three, four)

Kiss me hard before you go

I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you the best

I got that summertime, summertime sadness

Later's better than never
Even if you're gone, I'm gonna drive (Drive)

146,It's Time,Imagine Dragons,"So this is what you meant
When you said that you were spent
And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit
Right to the top
Don't hold back
Packing my bags and giving the academy a rain check

I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand?
That I'm never changing who I am

So this is where you fell
And I am left to sell
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell
Right to the top
Don't look back
Turn in the rags and giving the commodities a rain check

I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand?
That I'm never changing who I am
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand?
That I'm never changing who I am

This road never looked so lonely
This house doesn't burn down slowly
To ashes, to ashes

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand?
That I'm never changing who I am
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was

Okay, back when I was sleeping in my mama crib
Or even back when I was up there in Mohammed crib
Paying seventeen hundred for the rent, money well spent
No heater, but a nigga made heat, may I vent?
Had a thing for ya, even wrote the song ""Dreams"" for ya
‘Cause I had dreams for ya, thoughts of a ring for ya
Childish shit, you know child and shit
Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit
Now a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip
Back home, I'm grown now, and the city's my throne now, huh
The same clubs that I used to get tossed out
Life got Kriss Kross'd: totally crossed out
‘Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out
Old chicks crying ‘cause they know that they lost out
But I'm still on you, I'm still on you
My drink spill on me, while I feel on you, I'm sayin'—

Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?

Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?

And we are, we are, we are (She got me)

Well, this has got to be the longest crush ever
If I ever get to fuck it'd be the longest bust ever
Love is a drug, like the strongest stuff ever and
Fuck it, I'm on one, you feel me?
She on a power trip, she got me where she want a nigga
Wife'ing in the club, man, my homies gon' disown a nigga
Like, ""Give me twenty dollars, dollars!""
Ass stupid, how you get to college, college?
I'm in your city and I'm wonderin' if you're home now
Went and found a man, but I'm hopin' you're alone now
Can't help but feeling like I dropped the ball, cliché
I used to pop up on you at the mall each day
Now, typically I kick game like Eastbay
But you got a nigga freeze-framed yelling: ""Please play!""
For Pete's sake, homie, pull it together
Just fuck her one time and be through with forever, but—

Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want ya, yeah

Hotter than a fantasy
Lonely like a highway
She's livin' in a world and it's on fire
Filled with catastrophe

Oh-oh, she got both feet on the ground
And she's burnin' it down
Oh-oh, she got her head in the clouds
And she's not backin' down

This girl is on fire

She's walkin' on fire

Never put my love out on the line
Never said ""yes"" to the right guy
Never had trouble getting what I want
But when it comes to you, I'm never good enough
When I don't care
I can play 'em like a Ken doll
Won't wash my hair
Then make 'em bounce like a basketball

But you make me wanna act like a girl
Paint my nails and wear high heels
Yes, you, make me so nervous
That I just can't hold your hand

You make me glow

And every time I try to be myself
It comes out wrong, like a cry for help
It's just not fair
Pain's more trouble than love is worth
I gasp for air
It feels so good, but you know it hurts

But you make me wanna act like a girl
Paint my nails and wear perfume
For you, make me so nervous
That I just can't hold your hand

You make me glow
But I cover up, won't let it show
So I'm puttin' my defenses up (Up)

They're burning, I'd rather be numb (I'd rather be numb)
And there's no one else to blame (No one else to blame)
So scared, I take off and I run
I'm flyin' too close to the sun
And I burst into flames (Flames, flames)

You make me glow
But I cover up, won't let it show
So I'm puttin' my defenses up (Up)

I really wanna love somebody
I really wanna dance the night away
I know we're only halfway there
But you take me all the way, you take me all the way
I really wanna touch somebody
I think about you every single day
I know we're only halfway there
But you take me all the way, you take me all the way

Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh

I don't know where to start, I'm just a little lost
I wanna feel like we're never gonna ever stop
I don't know what to do, I'm right in front of you
Asking you to stay, you should stay, stay with me tonight, yeah

I really wanna love somebody
I really wanna dance the night away
I know we're only halfway there
But you take me all the way, you take me all the way
I really wanna touch somebody
I think about you every single day
I know we're only halfway there
But you take me all the way, you take me all the way

Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh

151,I Will Wait,Mumford & Sons,"57 ContributorsI Will Wait Lyrics
Well, I came home
Like a stone
And I fell heavy into your arms
These days of dust
Which we've known
Will blow away with this new sun

But I'll kneel down
Wait for now
And I'll kneel down
Know my ground
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you

So break my step
And relent
Well, you forgave and I won't forget
Know what we've seen
And him with less
Now in some way, shake the excess

'Cause I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you

Now I'll be bold
As well as strong
And use my head alongside my heart
So tame my flesh
And fix my eyes
A tethered mind, freed from the lies

And I'll kneel down
Wait for now
I'll kneel down
Know my ground
Woo!

Well, raise my hands
Paint my spirit gold
And bow my head
Keep my heart slow

'Cause I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you
And I will wait, I will wait for you"
152,Try,Pink,"Ever wonder about what he's doing
How it all turned to lies?
Sometimes I think﻿ that it's better
To never ask why

Where there is desire, there is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame, someone's bound to get burned
But just because it burns doesn't mean you're gonna die
You've gotta get up and try, try, try
Gotta get up and try, try, try
You gotta get up and try, try, try

Eh, eh, eh

Funny how the heart can be deceiving
More than just a couple times
Why do we fall in love so easy?
Even when it's not right

Where there is desire, there is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame, someone's bound to get burned
But just because it burns doesn't mean you're gonna die
You've gotta get up and try, try, try
Gotta get up and try, try, try
You gotta get up and try, try, try

Ever worried that it might be ruined
And does it make you wanna cry?
When you're out there doing what you're doing
Are you just getting by?
Tell me, are you just getting by, by, by?

Where there is desire, there is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame, someone's bound to get burned
But just because it burns doesn't mean you're gonna die
You've gotta get up and try, try, try
Gotta get up and try, try, try
You gotta get up and try, try, try
Gotta get up and try, try, try
Gotta get up and try, try, try
You gotta get up and try, try, try
Gotta get up and try, try, try

You gotta get up and try, try, try
Gotta get up and try, try, try"
153,Wagon Wheel,Darius Rucker,"Heading down south to the land of the pines
I'm thumbing my way into North Caroline
Staring up the road and pray to God I see headlights
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
And I'm a-hoping for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight

So rock me, mama, like a wagon wheel
Rock me, mama, any way you feel
Hey, mama, rock me
Rock me, mama, like the wind and the rain
Rock me, mama, like a southbound train
Hey, mama, rock me

Running from the cold up in New England
I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band
My baby plays the guitar, I pick a banjo now
Oh, north country winters keep a-getting me down
Lost my money playing poker so I had to leave town
But I ain't turning back to living that old life no more

So rock me, mama, like a wagon wheel
Rock me, mama, any way you feel
Hey, mama, rock me
Yeah, rock me, mama, like the wind and the rain
Rock me, mama, like a southbound train
Hey, mama, rock me

Walking to the south out of Roanoke
I caught a trucker out of Philly had a nice long toke
But he's a headed west from the Cumberland gap
To Johnson City, Tennessee
And I got to get a move on before the sun
I hear my baby calling my name and I know that she's the only one
And if I die in Raleigh at least I will die free

So rock me, mama, like a wagon wheel
Rock me, mama, any way you feel
Hey, mama, rock me
Oh, rock me, mama, like the wind and the rain
Rock me, mama, like a southbound train
Hey, hey, mama, rock me
So rock me, mama, like a wagon wheel
Rock me, mama, any way you feel
Hey, hey, mama, rock me

You can rock me

When everything's wrong, you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love
I need your love

I take a deep breath every time I pass your door
I know you're there, but I can't see you anymore
And that's the reason you're in the dark
I've been a stranger ever since we fell apart

And I feel so helpless here
Watch, my eyes are filled with fear
Tell me, do you feel the same?
Hold me in your arms again
I need your love, I need your time
When everything's wrong, you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love

I need your love

Now I'm dreaming, will I ever find you now?
I walk in circles, but I'll never figure out
What I mean to you, do I belong?
I try to fight this, but I know I'm not that strong

And I feel so helpless here
Watch, my eyes are filled with fear
Tell me, do you feel the same?
Hold me in your arms again
I need your love, I need your time
When everything's wrong, you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love

I need your love

All the years, all the times
You have never been to blame
And now my eyes are open
And now my heart is closing
And all the tears, all the lies, all the waste
I've been trying to make a change
And now my eyes are open

The song was co-written by Nate Ruess of the band Fun.
I hear your heartbeat to the beat of the drums
Oh, what a shame that you came here with someone
So, while you're here in my arms
Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young

Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young

Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young

Young hearts, out our minds, runnin' 'til we outta time
Wild childs, lookin' good, livin' hard just like we should
Don't care who's watchin' when we tearin' it up (You know)
That magic that we got, nobody can touch (Fo' sho')

Lookin' for some trouble tonight (Yeah)
Take my hand, I'll show you the wild side
Like it's the last night of our lives (Uh-huh)
We'll keep dancin' 'til we die

Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young

Young punks takin' shots, strippin' down to dirty socks
Music up, gettin' hot, kiss me, gimme all you got
It's pretty obvious that you got a crush (You know)
That magic in your pants, it's makin' me blush (Fo' sho')

Lookin' for some trouble tonight (Yeah)

157,Some Nights,Fun,"Some nights, I stay up cashin' in my bad luck
Some nights, I call it a draw
Some nights, I wish that my lips could build a castle
Some nights, I wish they'd just fall off
But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh, Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for, oh
(Oh-ooh, oh, oh) What do I stand for?
(Oh-ooh, oh, oh) What do I stand for?
Most nights, I don't know anymore

Oh, oh, oh-ooh, oh, oh
Oh-ooh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-ooh, oh, oh
Oh-ooh, oh, oh, oh-oh

This is it, boys, this is war
(Oh, oh, oh-ooh, oh, oh)
What are we waiting for?
(Oh-ooh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
Why don't we break the rules already?
I was never one to believe the hype
(Oh, oh, oh-ooh, oh, oh)
Save that for the black and white
(Oh-ooh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
Try twice as hard, and I'm half as liked
But here they come again to jack my style

And that's alright (That's alright)
I found a martyr in my bed tonight
She stops my bones from wondering
Just who I, who I, who I
Am, oh, who am I? Mm-mm
Mm-mm

Well, some nights, I wish that this all would end
'Cause I could use some friends for a change
And some nights, I'm scared you'll forget me again
Some nights, I always win (I always win)
But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh, Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for, oh
(Oh-ooh, oh, oh) What do I stand for?
(Oh-ooh, oh, oh) What do I stand for?
Most nights, I don't know

(Oh, come on) So this is it?
I sold my soul for this?
Washed my hands of that for this?
I miss my mom and dad for this?
(Oh, come on) No, when I see stars, when I see
When I see stars, that's all they are
When I hear songs, they sound like a swan
So come on, oh, come on
Oh, come on, oh, come on

Well, that is it, guys, that is all
(Oh, oh, oh-ooh, oh, oh)
Five minutes in, and I'm bored again
(Oh-ooh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
Ten years of this, I'm not sure if anybody understands
This one is not for the folks at home
(Oh, oh, oh-ooh, oh, oh)
Sorry to leave, Mom, I had to go
(Oh-ooh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
Who the fuck wants to die alone
All dried up in the desert sun?

My heart is breakin' for my sister
And the con that she called ""love""
And then I look into my nephew's eyes
Man, you wouldn't believe
The most amazing things
That can come from
Some terrible nights

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah (Alright, come on)

Oh, oh, oh-ooh, oh, oh
Oh-ooh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-ooh, oh, oh
Oh-ooh, oh, oh, oh-oh

The other night, you wouldn't believe
The dream I just had about you and me
I'd called you up, but we both agreed
It's for the best you didn't listen, no
It's for the best we get our distance, oh-oh-oh
For the best, you didn't listen
It's for the best we get our distance, oh-oh-oh-oh"
158,Bad,Wale,"169 ContributorsBad LyricsTaken from Tiara Thomas' original version of “Bad” which was sampled from the song Some Cut by Trillville ft. Lil Scrappy.
Monogamy or whatever you call it
I'm startin' to think it ain't for e'rybody
Most of us is rushin' into it anyways
You know what I'm sayin'?
You ain't rushin' for love, and I ain't up here to judge
Let's neglect the what if's
And make it do what it does, let's get it

Is it bad that I never made love?
No, I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck
I'll be your bad girl, I'll prove it to ya
I can't promise that I'll be good to ya
'Cause I had some issues
I won't commit, no, not havin' it
But at least I can admit
That I'll be bad, no, to you (To you)
Yeah, I'll be good in bed
But I'll be bad to you
Bad that I never made love
No, I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck (Let's get it)

Bad girls ain't no good
And the good girls ain't no fun
And the hood girls want a smart nigga
College girls all want a thug
So it seems that we fiend what we don't need
Got a thing for a queen who know when to leave
I ain't 'bout to judge you, don't judge me
You ain't gotta really sing about your rap sheet
'Cause I heard you (Bad, no) in the literal sense I mean that
Rough sex, sayin' I love ya, but to kiss them is sayin' you mean that (Bad, no)
I know, I just be callin' her mean-ass
Oh the irony, got the bomb indeed, but the problem is probably a deep past
Still I'm feelin' of somethin' I need bad
Thinkin' if I get her, I get her to need this
I don't need emotions to open your deep sea
I conceive an ocean by goin' between legs
Beg? Nope—bed, floor, dope; go for it, couch now
Slow motion around, put it down
Lord knows she was gone 'fore the morn', hold up

Is it bad that I never made love?
No, I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck
I'll be your bad girl, I'll prove it to ya
I can't promise that I'll be good to ya
'Cause I had some issues
I won't commit, no, not havin' it
But at least I can admit
That I'll be bad, no, to you (To you)
Yeah, I'll be good in bed (Yeah)
But I'll be bad to you (Let me tell you 'bout her, look)

She hurt feelings, she break hearts
She stay quiet, she play smart
She take pride in goin' out
And gettin' hollered at and sayin' nah
She no saint, but she don't pose
She don't wear make-up by the boatload
Ridin' through lake shore with the nose up
She don't really date much, but it slows her up
She got haters, but we all do
Heard you're winter-time cold, shawty, fall through
Baby, look at they approach, how they court you
All those minds games, nevermind, 'cause they all lose (Bad, no)
In the physical sense I mean that
I ain't tryna kiss up, suck up, feed gas
I ain't like them nigga you suckin' your teeth at, nope (Bad, no)
Play big, trust me I'll humble yo' mean-ass
Look, shawty is actually in prevent
'Cause the one in front of her is workin' with deep threat
Yep—bed, floor, couch, more
More, shower, Lord, perm, done
Love? Nah, called in the morn'
Cell number wasn't on, goddamn

Is it bad that I never made love?
No, I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck
I'll be your bad girl, I'll prove it to ya
I can't promise that I'll be good to ya
'Cause I had some issues
I won't commit, no, not havin' it
But at least I can admit
That I'll be bad, no, to you (To you)
Yeah, I'll be good in bed
But I'll be bad to you
Bad that I never made love
No, I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck"

When life leaves you high and dry
I'll be at your door tonight
If you need help, if you need help
I'll shut down the city lights
I'll lie, cheat, I'll beg and bribe
To make you well, to make you well

When enemies are at your door
I'll carry you away from war
If you need help, if you need help
Your hope dangling by a string
I'll share in your suffering
To make you well, to make you well

Give me reasons to believe
That you would do the same for me

And I will do it for you, for you
Baby, I'm not moving on
I'll love you long after you're gone
For you, for you
You will never sleep alone
I'll love you long after you're gone
And long after you're gone, gone, gone

When you fall like a statue
I'm gon' be there to catch you
Put you on your feet, you on your feet
And if your well is empty
Not a thing will prevent me
Tell me what you need, what do you need?

I surrender honestly
You've always done the same for me

So I will do it for you, for you
Baby, I'm not moving on
I'll love you long after you're gone
For you, for you
You will never sleep alone
I'll love you long after you're gone
And long after you're gone, gone, gone

You're my backbone
You're my cornerstone
You're my crutch when my legs stop moving
You're my head start
You're my rugged heart
You're the pulse that I've always needed
Like a drum, baby, don't stop beating
Like a drum, baby, don't stop beating
Like a drum, baby, don't stop beating
Like a drum my heart never stops beating

For you, for you
Baby, I'm not moving on
I'll love you long after you're gone
For you, for you
You will never sleep alone
I'll love you long after you're gone
For you, for you
Baby, I'm not moving on
I'll love you long after you're gone
For you, for you
You will never sleep alone
I'll love you long
Long after you're gone

Like a drum, baby, don't stop beating

161,Demons,Imagine Dragons,"When the days are cold and the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale

I wanna hide the truth, I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

At the curtain's call it's the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made

Don't wanna let you down, but I am hell-bound
Though this is all for you, don't wanna hide the truth
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

They say it's what you make, I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul, I need to let you go
Your eyes, they shine so bright, I wanna save that light
I can't escape this now, unless you show me how

When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide"

But, baby, I been, I been prayin' hard

I see this life like a swingin' vine
Swing my heart across the line
In my face is flashin' signs
Seek it out and ye shall find

The old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
On just doin' what we're told

I feel somethin' so right doin' the wrong thing
And I feel somethin' so wrong doin' the right thing
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive

I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go

I know you wanna get behind the wheel, but only one Rida
Eyes shut, still got me swimming like a diver
Can't let go, I got fans in Okinawa
My heart to Japan, quake losers and survivors
Norway, no, you didn't get my flowers
No way to say it better, but the killer was a coward
Face just showered, the minute in a hour
Heard about the news, whole day went sour
Bitter moments got me feeling like a Lemonhead
Put you in the box just as poisonous as cigarettes
There go my regards, but regardless I get arrested
Ain't worried about the killers, just the young and restless
Getting mad 'cause there's a quarter million on my necklace
DUI never said I was driving reckless
You and I know that jealously is not impressive
Oh no, I can't stop, I was destined

I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go

Champagne bucket still got two tears in it
And I put that on my tattoo of Jimi Hendrix
Get the pressed leather outfit all in it
'Cause the press tell it all, get a meal ticket
Kleenex, get a call, just a lil visit
Sacrifice just to make a hit still vivid
Reality stressed when you're blessed, just kill critics
Bugatti never meant I'm rich, just God-fearing
Look at me steering, got the boss staring
Got a good feeling, Mr. Mike Caren
Tell them Billie Jeans, I'm on another planet
Thank E-Class, Big Chuck and Lee Prince's parents
Buy my momma chandeliers, I'm in tears, dammit
Thirty years you'd have thought these emotions vanish
Tryna live, tryna figure how your sister vanished
No cheers, I know you woulda panicked

I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go

When I need a healing, I just look up to the ceiling
I see the sun coming down, I know it's all better now
When I need a healing, I just look up to the ceiling
I see the sun coming down, I know it's all better now
When I need a healing, I just look up to the ceiling
I see the sun coming down I know it's all better now
When I need a healing, I just look up to the ceiling
I see the sun coming down, I know it's all better now

I know

I think of letting go, go, go

(Hey)
(Hey)

I don't like walking around this old and empty house
So hold my hand, I'll walk with you, my dear
The stairs creak as you sleep, it's keeping me awake
It's the house telling you to close your eyes
And some days, I can't even dress myself
It's killing me to see you this way
'Cause though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

(Hey)
(Hey)
(Hey)

There's an old voice in my head that's holding me back
Well, tell her that I miss our little talks
Soon it will be over and buried with our past
We used to play outside when we were young
And full of life and full of love
Some days, I don't know if I am wrong or right
Your mind is playing tricks on you, my dear
'Cause though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

(Hey) Don't listen to a word I say
(Hey) The screams all sound the same
(Hey) Though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

(Hey)
(Hey)

You're gone, gone, gone away, I watched you disappear
All that's left is a ghost of you
Now we're torn, torn, torn apart, there's nothing we can do
Just let me go, we'll meet again soon
Now wait, wait, wait for me, please hang around
I'll see you when I fall asleep

(Hey) Don't listen to a word I say
(Hey) The screams all sound the same
(Hey) Though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore
Don't listen to a word I say
(Hey) The screams all sound the same
(Hey) Though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

Though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore
Though the truth may vary

I never thought it would be you
When we were chillin'
Smilin' in the photobooth
But we got closer (Yeah)
Soon you were eating off my spoon
You're comin' over
And we would talk all afternoon

Tonight we'll just get drunk, disturb the peace
Find your hands all over me
And then you bite your lip, whisper and say
""We're goin' all the way""

Tonight, take me to the other side
Sparks fly like the Fourth of July
Just take me to the other side
I see that sexy look in your eyes
And I know, we ain't friends anymore
If we walk down this road, we'll be lovers for sho'
So tonight, kiss me like it's do or die
And take me to the other side

Ayy, this could be perfect (Yeah)
But we won't know unless we try (Try)
I know you're nervous
So just sit back and let me drive

Tonight we'll just get drunk, disturb the peace
Find your hands all over me
And then you bite your lip, whisper and say
""We're goin' all the way""

Tonight, take me to the other side
Sparks fly like the Fourth of July
Just take me to the other side
I see that sexy look in your eyes
And I know, we ain't friends anymore
If we walk down this road, we'll be lovers for sho'
So tonight, kiss me like it's do or die

Oh-oh-oh, ooh (Kiss me like it's do or die)
Oh-oh-oh, ooh (And take me to the other side)

Tonight we'll just get drunk, disturb the peace
Let your love crash into me
And then you bite your lip, whisper and say

Tonight, take me to the other side
Sparks fly like the Fourth of July (Blastin' through the air)
Just take me to the other side (Take me, baby)

And I know, we ain't friends anymore (Oh yeah)
If we walk down this road, we'll be lovers for sho'

166,Berzerk,Eminem,"Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad, 'cause my rhymes on the rag
Just like I did with addiction, I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence whether to picket
But quick to get it impaled when I tell 'em, ""Stick it!""
So sick, I'm looking pale—wait, that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
The art of MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been Public Enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch

Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) All night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) All night long

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.​
So, baby, make just like K-Fed
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say, ""Fuck it!"" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (Go berserk)
Grab your vial, yeah

Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
Khakis pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it ain't that aftershave
Or cologne that made 'em just faint
Plus I showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl, your body's bangin', jump me in, dang, bang-bang
Yes siree 'Bob', I was thinking the same thang
So come get on this Kid's rock, baw with da baw, dang-dang
Pow-p-p-p-pow, chica, pow, chica, wow-wow
Got your gal blowin' up a valve, v-v-valve-valve
Ain't slowin' it down, throw in the towel, t-t-towel-towel
Dumb it down, I don't know how, huh-huh, how-how
At least I know that I don't know
Question is, are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid?
Hope so, now ho

Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) All night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) All night long

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.​
So crank the bass up like crazy
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say, ""Fuck it!"" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (Go berzerk)
Get your vinyls


And they say that love is powerful as cough syrup in styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian, Lamar, oh
Sorry, yo—we done both set the bar low
Far as hard drugs are, though, that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And, girl, I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am tryin' to find a way to get you alone: car note
Oh, Marshall Mathers
Shithead with a potty mouth, get the bar of soap lathered
Kangol's and Carheartless Cargos
Girl, you're fixin' to get your heart broke
Don't be absurd, ma'am, you birdbrain, baby
I ain't called anybody baby since Birdman, unless you're a swallow (Ha-ha!)
Word, Rick? (Word, man, you heard)
But don't get discouraged, girl
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam

Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) All night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) All night long

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.​
So, baby, make just like K-Fed
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say, ""Fuck it!"" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (Go berserk)
Grab your vial, yeah

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.​

Get your vials"
167,Catch My Breath,Kelly Clarkson,"I don't wanna be left behind
Distance was a friend of mine
Catching breath in a web of lies
I've spent most of my life
Riding waves, playing acrobat
Shadowboxing the other half
Learning how to react
I've spent most of my time

Catching my breath, letting it go
Turning my cheek for the sake of the show
Now that you know, this is my life
I won't be told what's supposed to be right

Catch my breath
No one can hold me back, I ain't got time for that
Catch my breath
Won't let 'em get me down, it's all so simple now

Addicted to the love I found
Heavy heart, now a weightless cloud
Making time for the ones that count
I'll spend the rest of my time
Laughing hard with the windows down
Leaving footprints all over town
Keeping faith, karma comes around
I will spend the rest of my life

Catching my breath, letting it go
Turning my cheek for the sake of the show
Now that you know, this is my life
I won't be told what's supposed to be right

Catch my breath
No one can hold me back, I ain't got time for that
Catch my breath
Won't let 'em get me down, it's all so simple now

You helped me see
The beauty in everything

Catching my breath, letting it go
Turning my cheek for the sake of the show
Now that you know, this is my life
I won't be told what's supposed to be right
Catching my breath, letting it go
Turning my cheek for the sake of the show
Now that you know, this is my life
I won't be told what's supposed to be right

(Catch my breath) Catch my breath
No one can hold me back, I ain't got time for that
Catch my breath
Won't let 'em get me down, it's all so simple now
It's all so simple now

Catching my breath, letting it go
Turning my cheek for the sake of the show
Now that you know, this is my life
I won't be told what's supposed to be right

No one can hold me back, I ain't got time for that

It don't matter what plans I got, I can break 'em
Yeah, I can turn this thing around at the next red light
And I don't mind tellin' all the guys I can't meet 'em
Hell, we can all go raise some hell on any other night
Girl, I don't care, oh, I just gotta see what you're wearin'
Your hair, is it pulled up or fallin' down?
Oh, I just have to see it now

If you wanna call me, call me, call me (Call me, call me, call me)
You don't have to worry 'bout it, baby
You can wake me up in the dead of the night
Wreck my plans, baby, that's alright
This is a drop everything kind of thing (Drop everything)
Swing on by, I'll pour you a drink
The door's unlocked; I'll leave on the lights
Baby, you can crash my party anytime

Ain't a spot downtown that's rockin' the way that you rock me
Ain't a bar that can make me buzz the way that you do
I could be on the front row of the best show
And look down and see your face on my phone
And I'm gone so long, hang on
I'll meet you in a minute or two

If you wanna call me, call me, call me (Call me, call me, call me)
You don't have to worry 'bout it, baby
You can wake me up in the dead of the night
Wreck my plans, baby, that's alright
This is a drop everything kind of thing (Drop everything)
Swing on by, I'll pour you a drink
The door's unlocked; I'll leave on the lights
Baby, you can crash my party anytime

If it's two in the mornin' and you're feelin' lonely
And wonderin' what I'm doing

Go ahead and call me, call me, call me (Call me, call me, call me)
You don't have to worry 'bout it, baby
You can wake me up in the dead of the night
Wreck my plans, baby that's alright
This is a drop everything kind of thing (Drop everything)
Swing on by, I'll pour you a drink

Well, I wanna be scared, don't wanna know why
Wanna feel good, don't have to be right
The world makes all kinds of rules for love
I say you gotta let it do what it does
I don't want just another hug and a kiss goodnight
Catching up calls and a date sometimes
I love that we're rebels and we still believe
We're the kind of crazy people wish that they could be, yeah
Uh, and I know we're crazy, yeah

But I don't want ""good"" and I don't want ""good enough""

Like an angel in disguise
But if you meet a friendly horse
Will you communicate by

What is your sound? Will we ever know?
Will always be a mystery
What do you say?

You're my guardian angel hiding in the woods
What is your sound?

173,Best Song Ever,One Direction,"Maybe it's the way she walked (Ow!)
Straight into my heart and stole it
Through the doors and past the guards (Ow!)
Just like she already owned it

I said, ""Can you give it back to me?""
She said, ""Never in your wildest dreams""

And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line, now I can't remember
How it goes, but I know that I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever

I think it went, ""Oh, oh, oh,"" I think it went, ""Yeah, yeah, yeah""
I think it goes (Woo!)

Said her name was Georgia Rose (Ow!)
And her daddy was a dentist
Said I had a dirty mouth (I got a dirty mouth)
But she kissed me like she meant it

I said, ""Can I take you home with me?""
She said, ""Never in your wildest dreams""

And we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line, now I can't remember (How it goes, but I know)
How it goes, but I know that I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever

I think it went, ""Oh, oh, oh,"" I think it went, ""Yeah, yeah, yeah""

And I know, you know, I know you'll remember me

And I know, you know, I hope you'll remember how we danced (Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
How we danced (Oh, oh, oh, one, two, one, two, three, ow!)

How we danced all night to the best song ever (How we danced)
We knew every line, now I can't remember (We knew every line)
How it goes, but I know that I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night (We danced, we danced) to the best song ever (It goes something like this)
And we danced all night to the best song ever (Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
We knew every line, now I can't remember (Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
How it goes, but I know that I won't forget her (Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know that I won't forget her)

174,The A Team,Ed Sheeran,"White lips, pale face
Breathin' in the snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, days end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men

And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen, but lately
Her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
""The worst things in life come free to us""

'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside tonight
And in a pipe, she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly

Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, banknotes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone

And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen, but lately
Her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
""The worst things in life come free to us""

'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
But she don't wanna go outside tonight
And in a pipe, she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly

An angel will die, covered in white
Closed eye and hopin' for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line

And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen, but lately
Her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
""The worst things in life come free to us""

And we're all under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And we don't wanna go outside tonight
And in a pipe, we fly to the Motherland
Or sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly

Angels to fly
Fly, fly
For angels to fly
To fly, to fly
Angels to die"
175,Carry On,Fun,"68 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsCarry On Lyrics
Well, I woke up to the sound of silence
The cars were cutting like knives in a fistfight
And I found you with a bottle of wine
Your head in the curtains and heart like the fourth of July
You swore and said, ""We are not, we are not shining stars""
This I know, I never said we are
Though I've never been through hell like that
I've closed enough windows to know you can never look back

If you're lost and alone, or you're sinkin' like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound of your feet upon the ground
Carry on
Carry on, carry on

So I met up with some friends at the edge of the night
At a bar off 75
And we talked and talked about how our parents will die
All our neighbors and wives
But I'd like to think I can cheat it all
To make up for the times I've been cheated on
And it's nice to know when I was left for dead
I was found and now I don't roam these streets
I am not the ghost you are to me

If you're lost and alone, or you're sinkin' like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound of your feet upon the ground and
Carry on

Woah, my head is on fire, but my legs are fine
After all, they are mine
Lay your clothes down on the floor
Close the door, hold the phones
Show me how no one's ever gonna stop us now


'Cause we are, we are shining stars
We are invincible, we are who we are
On our darkest day, when we're miles away
So we'll come, we will find our way home

If you're lost and alone, or you're sinkin' like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound of your feet upon the ground and
Carry on

(No one's ever gonna stop us now)
(No one's ever gonna stop us now)
(No one's ever gonna stop us now)"
176,Highway Don't Care,Tim McGraw,"Bet your window's rolled down and your hair's pulled back
And I bet you got no idea you're going way too fast
You're trying not to think about what went wrong
Trying not to stop 'til you get where you goin'
You're trying to stay awake so I bet you turn on the radio
And the song goes

I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby, oh, baby

The highway won't hold you tonight
The highway don't know you're alive
The highway don't care if you're all alone
But I do, I do
The highway won't dry your tears
The highway don't need you here
The highway don't care if you're coming home
But I do, I do

I bet you got a dead cell phone in your shotgun seat
Yeah, I bet you're bending God's ear talking 'bout me
You're trying not to let the first tear fall out
You're trying not to think about turning around
You're trying not to get lost in the sound but that song is always on
So you sing along

I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby, oh baby

The highway won't hold you tonight
The highway don't know you're alive
The highway don't care if you're all alone
But I do, I do
The highway won't dry your tears
The highway don't need you here

Uh, uh

I got that real good, feel good stuff
Up under the seat of my big black jacked up truck
Rollin' on 35's, pretty girl by my side
You got that sun tan skirt and boots
Waiting on you to look my way and scoot
Your little hot self over here
Girl, hand me another beer, yeah

All them other boys want to wine you up and take you downtown
But you look like the kind that likes to take it way out
Out where the corn rows grow, row, row my boat
Floatin' down the Flint River, catch us up a little catfish dinner
Going to sound like a winner, winner, when I lay you down and love you right
Yeah, that's my kind of night

Might sit down on my diamond plate tailgate
Put in my country-rock, hip-hop mixtape
Little Conway, a little T-Pain, might just make it rain
You can hang your t-shirt on a limb
Hit that bank and we can ease on in
Soak us up a little moonlight
You know I know what you like, yeah

All them other boys want to wine you up and take you downtown
But you look like the kind that likes to take it way out
Out where the corn rows grow, row, row my boat
Floatin' down the Flint River, catch us up a little catfish dinner
Going to sound like a winner, winner, when I lay you down and love you right
Yeah, that’s my kind of night
Yeah, that’s my kind of night

My kinda-- your kind-- is this kind of night
We dance in the dark and your lips land on mine
Oh oh oh oh oh, gonna get our love on
Oh oh oh oh oh, time to get our buzz on

All them other boys want to wine you up and take you downtown
But you look like the kind that likes to take it way out
Out where the corn rows grow, row, row my boat
Floatin' down the Flint River, catch us up a little catfish dinner
Going to sound like a winner, winner, when I lay you down and love you right
Yeah, that’s my kind of night

Yeah, that's my kind of night
That's my kind of night!

Now, I done grew up round some people livin' their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask, backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feel, some people wanna kill their sorrow
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes, lookin' to make a vow soon
That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup, I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me
""Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First, you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it

I see the feelin', the freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrived

Is in the bottom of a bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open, I release everything that corrode inside of me

But it turned into a party when I started talking to you
Now you're standing in the neon looking like a high I wanna be on
Baby it's your call, no pressure at all

You don’t have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter and lean a little closer
You don’t have to keep on smiling that smile that’s driving me wild and when the night is almost over
Meet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat and do a little bit of country song, hanging on
You don’t have to keep me fallin’ like this
But it’d sure be cool if you did

You can’t shoot me down cause you already knocked me dead
Got me falling apart with my heart talking out of my head
Let your mind take a little back road
Just as far as you wanna go
Baby I’ll do whatever you wanna do

You don't have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter
And lean a little closer
You don't have to keep on smiling that smile that's driving me wild
And when the night is almost over
Meet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat
And do a little bit of country song, hanging on
You don't have to keep me falling like this
But it'd sure be cool if you did

Have a night that you'll never forget
And now you're standing in the neon
Looking like a high I wanna be on

You don't have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter
And lean a little closer
You don't have to keep on smiling that smile that's driving me wild

For money, fame, for power out of greed
You won't ever find him where the rest go

And I can't seem to find no help or love for free
I know there's no need for me to panic
'Cause I'll find him, I'll find him next to me
When the skies are grey and all the doors are closing
And the rising pressure makes it hard to breathe
When all I need's a hand to stop the tears from falling
I will find him, I'll find him next to me

When we've spoilt the land and dried up all the sea
When everyone has lost their heads around us

188,Mama's Broken Heart,Miranda Lambert,"35 ContributorsMama’s Broken Heart LyricsDealing with a terrible breakup, Miranda debates revenge and crying, switching between violent rage and emotional failing. In the end, her mother’s hard words help bring Miranda back.
I cut my bangs with some rusty kitchen scissors
I screamed his name 'til the neighbors called the cops
I numbed the pain at the expense of my liver
Don't know what I did next, all I know I couldn't stop

Word got around to the barflies and the baptists
My mama's phone started ringin' off the hook
I can hear her now, sayin' she ain't gonna have it
Don't matter how you feel, it only matters how you look

Go and fix your make up, girl, it's just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin' like a lady
'Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain't my mama's broken heart

I wish I could be just a little less dramatic
Like a Kennedy when Camelot went down in flames
Leave it to me to be holding the matches
When the fire trucks show up and there's nobody else to blame

Can't get revenge and keep a spotless reputation (Ah)
Sometimes revenge's just a choice you gotta make (Ah)
My mama came from a softer generation
Where you get a grip and bite your lip just to save a little face

Go and fix your make up, girl, it's just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin' like a lady
'Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain't my mama's broken heart

Powder your nose, paint your toes
Line your lips and keep 'em closed
Cross your legs, dot your eyes
And never let 'em see you cry

Go and fix your make up, well, it's just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin' like a lady
'Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart
But this ain't my mama's broken heart"

Hey, girl, you make me wanna write a song
Sit you down, I'll sing it to you all night long
I've had a melody in my head
Since she walked in here and knocked me dead
Yeah, girl, you make me wanna write a song

And it goes like, ooh, what I wouldn't do
To write my name on your heart, get you wrapped in my arms
Baby, all around you
And it goes like, hey, girl, I'm blown away
But, yeah, it starts with a smile and it ends with an all-night-long slow kiss
Yeah, it goes like this

Hey, girl, you make me wanna drive you home
Get you outta here and get you all alone
I don't know what it is about you, baby
But I'm all messed up and it might sound crazy
But you make me wanna write a song

And it goes like, ooh, what I wouldn't do
To write my name on your heart, get you wrapped in my arms
Baby, all around you
And it goes like, hey, girl, I'm blown away
But, yeah, it starts with a smile and it ends with an all-night-long slow kiss
Yeah, it goes like this

Lookin' at you lookin' at me that way (Lookin' at me that way)
Makes me wanna grab my old guitar and play

Somethin' like, ooh, what I wouldn't do
To write my name on your heart, get you wrapped in my arms

Well, all the parties on the streets are talkin'
Store front mannequins sleeping in the lights
We used to smoke while we were jay-walking
Like it was your birthday every other Saturday night
Knew the bands so we never payed our cover
Wrote our names on the bathroom tiles
We never dressed to impress all the others
They would let us in on our laid back kinda style
But boy, you know it's been a while

And I don't know why you don't take me downtown
Like you got anywhere better to be
You talk it up and give me the go 'round, 'round
Like a good time tease
I'm only counting on your cancellation
When I should be counting on you at my door
Did you forget about how we went around?
I don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore
Oh, anymore

I got some platforms sitting in the corner
They wanna stroll on a city sidewalk
I got a dress that'll show a little uh-uh
But you ain't getting uh-uh
If you don't come pick me up (Damn)
Show me off (Wow)
You might be tired, but I'm not

And I don't know why you don't take me downtown
Like you got anywhere better to be
You talk it up and give me the go 'round, 'round
Like a good time tease
I'm only counting on your cancellation
When I should be counting on you at my door
Did you forget about how we went around?
I don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore


And I don't know why you don't take me downtown

Homemade jar of lemon drop, take a sip

Get your shine on

Summer sky drippin' rhinestones
Turn your party lights on

Ray-Bans got the whole world shaded
Chrome piece tucked in the console
Ridin' high, roll up on the down low
Feelin' lucky, got hooked up with some Kentucky clear
So slide that little sugar shaker over here

And get your shine on

195,Brave,Sara Bareilles,"You can be amazing
You can turn a phrase into a weapon or a drug
You can be the outcast
Or be the backlash of somebody's lack of love
Or you can start speaking up
Nothing's gonna hurt you the way that words do
When they settle 'neath your skin
Kept on the inside and no sunlight
Sometimes a shadow wins
But I wonder what would happen if you

Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave

I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I wanna see you be brave
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I wanna see you be brave

Everybody's been there
Everybody's been stared down by the enemy
Fallen for the fear
And done some disappearing, bow down to the mighty
Don't run, stop holding your tongue
Maybe there’s a way out of the cage where you live
Maybe one of these days, you can let the light in
And show me, how big your brave is

Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave

And since your history of silence
Won't do you any good
Did you think it would?
Let your words be anything but empty
Why don't you tell them the truth?

Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave

I just wanna see you

196,Let Her Go,Passenger,"Well, you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go

Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast
You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

But you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go

Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast
Well, you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too much and you dived too deep

Well, you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go, oh, woah, mm, oh
And you let her go, oh, woah, uh, no
Well, you let her go

'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go

'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go"

Don't you worry 'bout gettin' fixed up
When you wake up, you're pretty enough
Look out your window at the cloud of dust
That's my headlights, that's my truck
Come on, baby, don't you keep me waitin'
I gotta go, I've got a reservation
Tailgate for two underneath the stars
Kiss on your lips when you're in my arms

Woah
Girl, every now and then, you get a night like this
Woah
This one that we don't wanna miss, no

Come on, baby, let me take you on a night ride
Windows down, sittin' on my side
Tick tock, now we're knockin' on midnight
Me and you, girl, runnin' outta moonlight
I wanna hold you 'til the break of dawn
Hear the crickets sing a riverside love song
Hey, baby, all we got is all night
Come on now, we're runnin' outta moonlight

Girl, I bet you thought I lost my mind
Out of the blue pullin' into your drive
Wonder why I got you way out here
Have you ever seen a sky this clear?

Woah
Girl, you never looked better than you do right now
Woah
Oh, Heaven, let your light shine down

Come on, baby, let me take you on a night ride
Windows down, sittin' on my side
Tick tock, now we're knockin' on midnight
Me and you, girl, runnin' outta moonlight
I wanna hold you 'til the break of dawn
Hear the crickets sing a riverside love song
Hey, baby, all we got is all night
Come on now, we're runnin' outta moonlight

Woah
Girl, every now and then, you get a night like this
Woah
This one that we don't wanna miss, no

Come on, baby, let me take you on a night ride
Windows down, sittin' on my side
Tick tock, now we're knockin' on midnight
Me and you, girl, runnin' outta moonlight
I wanna hold you 'til the break of dawn
Hear the crickets sing a riverside love song
Hey, baby, all we got is all night
Come on now, we're runnin' outta moonlight

Hey, baby, don't it feel so right?
Come on now, we're runnin' outta moonlight
All I wanna do is hold you tight
Come on, come on, come on, we're runnin' outta moonlight

Woah
Yeah, we're runnin' outta moonlight

199,Still Into You,Paramore,"Can't count the years on one hand that we've been together
I need the other one to hold you, make you feel, make you feel better
It's not a walk in the park to love each other
But when our fingers interlock, can't deny, can't deny you're worth it

'Cause after all this time
I'm still into you

I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)

Recount the night that I first met your mother
And on the drive back to my house, I told you that, I told you that I loved ya
You felt the weight of the world fall off your shoulder
And to your favorite song, we sang along to the start of forever

And after all this time
I'm still into you

'Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges

Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you

'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh

How many times do I have to tell you?
Even when you're crying, you're beautiful, too
The world is beating you down, I'm around
Through every mood
You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing
In my head for you

My head's under water, but I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

'Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges

Risking it all, though it's hard

Stop holdin' your breath

I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
'Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Woo! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic 'cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Goin' coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith

Sometimes, I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders, no wonder
You're losin' your mind, the way it wanders
(New-hoo, ooh-hoo) Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo!
I think it went wanderin' off down
Yonder and stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
'Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
'Cause the very thing that I love's killin' me and I can't conquer it
My OCD's conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'

I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then, drums get killed and I'm comin' straight at
MCs, blood gets spilled then I'll
Take you back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fuckin' children, but if one kid
Out of a hundred million who are goin' through a
Struggle feels it and relates, that's great
It's payback, Russell Wilson fallin' way back
In the draft turn nothin' into somethin'
Still can make that straw into gold, chump, I will spin
Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straightjacket, face facts:
I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that

Livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams
And you know, we're on each other's team

We're on each other's team
And you know, we're on each other's team
We're on each other's team
And you know, and you know, and you know"
218,Let Her Go,Passenger,"Well, you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go

Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast
You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

But you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go

Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast
Well, you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too much and you dived too deep

Well, you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go, oh, woah, mm, oh
And you let her go, oh, woah, uh, no
Well, you let her go

'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go

'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go"
219,Royals,Lorde,"I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address
In a torn-up town, no postcode envy

But every song's like
Gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like
Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair

And we'll never be royals (Royals)
It don't run in our blood

And baby, I'll rule (I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule)
Let me live that fantasy

We count our dollars on the train to the party
And everyone who knows us knows
That we're fine with this, we didn't come from money

220,Let It Go,Idina Menzel,"The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
Not a footprint to be seen
A kingdom of isolation
And it looks like I'm the queen
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Couldn't keep it in, Heaven knows I tried
Don't let them in, don't let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
Well, now they know
Let it go, let it go
Can't hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn away and slam the door
I don't care
What they're going to say
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway
It's funny how some distance
Makes everything seem small
And the fears that once controlled me
Can't get to me at all

It's time to see what I can do
To test the limits and break through
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
I'm free
Let it go, let it go
I'm one with the wind and sky
Let it go, let it go
You'll never see me cry
Here I stand
And here I'll stay
Let the storm rage on
My power flurries through the air into the ground
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
I'm never goin' back, the past is in the past
Let it go, let it go
And I'll rise like the break of dawn
Let it go, let it go
That perfect girl is gone
Here I stand
In the light of day
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway"
221,Wake Me Up,Avicii,"Feelin' my way through the darkness
Guided by a beatin' heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well, life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well, that's fine by me

So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time, I was findin' myself and I
Didn't know﻿ I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time, I was findin' myself and I
Didn't know﻿ I was lost



I tried carryin' the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
Hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game﻿ made for everyone
And love is the prize

So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time, I was findin' myself and I
Didn't know﻿ I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time, I was findin' myself and I
I didn't know I was lost

I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know, I didn't know, I didn't know"
222,Demons,Imagine Dragons,"When the days are cold and the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale

I wanna hide the truth, I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

At the curtain's call it's the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made

Don't wanna let you down, but I am hell-bound
Though this is all for you, don't wanna hide the truth
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

They say it's what you make, I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul, I need to let you go
Your eyes, they shine so bright, I wanna save that light
I can't escape this now, unless you show me how

When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide"
223,Story of My Life,One Direction,"160 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsItalianoEspañolTürkçePolskiFrançaisDeutschStory of My Life Lyrics“Story of My Life” is the second single off of One Direction’s third album, Midnight Memories. It details the struggles of trying to chase after a girl who plays “hard to get.”
Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain
I leave my heart open, but it stays right here empty for days
She told me in the mornin' she don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die, these words will be written on my stone

And I'll be gone, gone tonight (Oh-oh-oh)
The ground beneath my feet is open wide (Oh-oh-oh)
The way that I've been holding on too tight (Oh-oh-oh)
With nothing in between

The story of my life, I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm
And time is frozen (The story of, the story of)
The story of my life, I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke inside
The story of my life (The story of, the story of)

Written on these walls are the colors that I can't change
Leave my heart open, but it stays right here in its cage
I know that in the mornin', I'll see us in the light up on the hill
Although I am broken, my heart is untamed still

And I'll be gone, gone tonight (Oh-oh-oh)
The fire beneath my feet is burning bright (Oh-oh-oh)
The way that I've been holding on so tight (Oh-oh-oh)
With nothing in between

The story of my life, I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm
And time is frozen (The story of, the story of)
The story of my life, I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke inside
The story of my life (The story of, the story of)

And I've been waiting for this time to come around
But, baby, running after you is like chasin' the clouds

The story of my life, I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm
And time is frozen

The story of my life, I give her hope (I give her hope)
I spend her love until she's broke inside ('Til she's broke inside)
The story of my life (The story of, the story of)

The story of my life
The story of my life (The story of, the story of)
The story of my life"

225,Black Widow,Iggy Azalea,"I'm gonna love ya
Until you hate me
And I'm gonna show ya
What's really crazy
You should've known better
Than to mess with me harder
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya
Gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Like a black widow, baby

This twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same
First we're both down to play, then somehow you go astray
We went from nothin' to something, liking to lovin'
It was us against the world, and now we just fucking?
It's like I loved you so much, and now I just hate you
Feelin' stupid for all the time that I gave you
I wanted all or nothin' for us, ain't no place in between
Might, might be me believin' what you say that you'll never mean
Like it'll last forever, but now forever ain't as long
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be stuck singin' this song
You were different from my last, but now you got 'em mirrored
And as it all plays out, I see it couldn't be clearer, now sing
You used to be thirsty for me
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, web that you weave
So, baby, now rest in peace (It's all over with now)

I'm gonna love ya
Until you hate me (Right)
And I'm gonna show ya (Show 'em what, show 'em what?)
What's really crazy
You should've known better
Than to mess with me harder (It's all over with now)
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya
Gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Like a black widow, baby

Black, black widow, baby

I'm gonna l-l-l-love you until it hurts
Just to get you, I'm doin' whatever works
You ain't ever met nobody that will do ya how I do ya
That'll bring you to your knees, praise Jesus, hallelujah
I'ma make you beg for it, plead for it
'Til you feel like you breathe for it, 'til you'll do any and everything for it
I want you to fiend for it, wake up and dream for it
'Til it's got you gaspin' for air and you lean forward
'Til they have a CAT scan to check on your mind and it's nothin' but me
On it (On it, on it), now it's me time, believe that
If it's yours and you want it, I want it, promise I need that
'Til I'm everywhere that you be at, I can't fall back or quit
'Cause this here is fatal attraction, so I take it all or I don't want (Shh)

You used to be thirsty for me (Right)
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, web that you weave
So, baby, now rest in peace (It's all over with now)
I'm gonna love ya
Until you hate me (Right)
And I'm gonna show ya (Show 'em what, show 'em what?)
What's really crazy (Oh)

(Woo, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)

I had a dream so big and loud
I jumped so high, I touched the clouds
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh (Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh)
I stretched my hands out to the sky
We danced with monsters through the night
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh (Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh)

I'm never gonna look back, woah
I'm never gonna give it up, no
Please don't wake me now
(Two, three, four)

(Woo, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh) This is gonna be the best day of my life

I howled at the moon with friends
And then the sun came crashing in
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh (Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh)
But all the possibilities
No limits, just epiphanies
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh (Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh)

I'm never gonna look back, woah
I'm never gonna give it up, no
Just don't wake me now

I hear it calling outside my window
I feel it in my soul (Soul)
The stars were burning so bright
The sun was out 'til midnight
I say we lose control (Control)

(Woo, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)

(Woo, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh) This is gonna be the best day of my life

231,Habits (Stay High),Tove Lo,"Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

I eat my dinner in my bathtub, then I go to sex clubs
Watchin' freaky people gettin' it on
It doesn't make me nervous, if anything, I'm restless
Yeah, I've been around and I've seen it all
I get home, I got the munchies, binge on all my Twinkies
Throw up in the tub, then I go to sleep
And I drank up all my money, dazed and kinda lonely

You're gone and I gotta stay
High all the time to keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
High all the time to keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Spend my days locked in a haze
Tryna forget you, babe, I fall back down
Gotta stay high all my life to forget I'm missin' you
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Pick up daddies at the playground, how I spend my day time
Loosen up their frown, make 'em feel alive
I make it fast and greasy, I'm numb and way too easy

You're gone and I gotta stay
High all the time to keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
High all the time to keep you off my mind

Tryna forget you, babe, I fall back down
Gotta stay high all my life to forget I'm missin' you

Stayin' in my play pretend, where the fun ain't got no end, oh
Can't go home alone again, need someone to numb the pain, oh
Stayin' in my play pretend, where the fun ain't got no end, oh-oh
Can't go home alone again, need someone to numb the pain

You're gone and I gotta stay
High all the time to keep you off my mind

High all the time to keep you off my mind

Sunbathing under the moon
Stars shining as your bones illuminate
First kiss just like a drug
Under your influence
You take me over, you're the magic in my veins
This must be love

You're the glitter in the darkness of my world
Just tell me what to do
I'll fall right into you
We're going under cast the spell, just say the word
I feel your love!

Boom clap, the sound of my heart

Why can't I keep my fingers off it?
Baby, I want you, na-na
Why can't I keep my fingers off you?
Baby, I want you, na-na
Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feelin' like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashin' lights, flashin' lights
You got me faded, faded, faded
Baby, I want you, na-na
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you, na-na
Drunk in love, I want you (Ah)
We woke up in the kitchen, sayin', ""How the hell did this shit happen?"", oh, baby
Drunk in love, we be all night
Last thing I remember is our beautiful bodies grindin' up in that club
Drunk in love
We be all night
Love, love
We be all night
Love, love

We be all night, and everything alright
No complaints from my body, so fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinkin', park it in my lot, 7-11
I'm rubbin' on it, rub-rubbin', if you scared, call that reverend
Boy, I'm drinkin', get my brain right, Armand de Brignac, gangster wife
Louis sheets, he sweat it out, like washrags, he wet it up
Boy, I'm drinkin', I'm singin' on the mic to my boy toys
Then I fill the tub up halfway, then ride it with my surfboard
Surfboard, surfboard
Grainin' on that wood, grainin'-grainin' on that wood
I'm swervin' on that, swervin'-swervin' on that
Big body been servin' all this, swerve, surfin' all in this good-good (Ha-ha-ha)

That D'USSÉ is the shit, if I do say so myself
If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself
Hold up, stumble all in the house, time to back up all of that mouth
That you had all in the car, talkin' 'bout you the baddest bitch thus far
Talkin' 'bout you be reppin' that Third, I wanna see all the shit that I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood, hope you can handle this curve, uh
Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side, ain't got the time to take drawers off
On sight
Catch a charge, I might
Beat the box up like Mike in '97, I bite
I'm Ike Turner, turn up, baby, no, I don't play
""Now eat the cake, Anna Mae,"" said, ""Eat the cake, Anna Mae""
I'm nice
For y'all to reach these heights
You gon' need G3, 4, 5, 6 flights
Sleep tight
We sex again in the mornin'
Your breasteses is my breakfast, we goin' in

We be all night
Love, love
We be all night
Love, love

I'm never tired, never tired
I been sippin', that's the only thing that's keepin' me on fire, we on fire
Didn't mean to spill that liquor all on my attire
I've been drinkin' watermelon
I want your body right here
Daddy, I want you right now
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you
We be all night

We jumped, never asking why
We kissed, I fell under your spell
A love no one could deny
Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you

I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me

I put you high up in the sky
And now, you're not coming down
It slowly turned, you let me burn
And now, we're ashes on the ground
Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life
I will always want you

I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
I came in like a wrecking ball
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Left me crashing in a blazing fall
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me

I never meant to start a war
I just wanted you to let me in
And instead of using force
I guess I should've let you win
I never meant to start a war
I just wanted you to let me in
I guess I should've let you win

Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you

I came in like a wrecking ball

Said, all I want from you is to see you tomorrow
And every tomorrow, maybe you'll let me borrow your heart
And is it too much to ask for every Sunday? Uh
And while we're at it, throw in every other day to start

I know people make promises all the time
Then they turn right around and break them
When someone cuts your heart open with a knife
Now you're bleedin'
But I could be that guy to heal it over time
And I won't stop until you believe it
'Cause baby, you're worth it

So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me
'Cause you might fuck around and find your dreams come true with me
Spend all your time and your money just to find out that my love was free
So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
It's not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
Fall, yeah

Now, how about I'll be the last voice you hear tonight?
And every other night for the rest of the nights that there are
And every mornin', I just wanna see you starin' back at me (Starin' back at me)
'Cause I know that's a good place to start

I know people make promises all the time
Then they turn right around and break them
When someone cuts your heart open with a knife
Now, you're bleedin'
Don't you know that I could be that guy to heal it over time?
And I won't stop until you believe it
'Cause baby, you're worth it

So, don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me
'Cause you might fuck around and find your dreams come true with me
Spend all your time and your money just to find out that my love was free
So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
It's not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me

No, I won't fill your mind
With broken promises and wasted time
And if you fall, you'll always land right in these arms
These arms of mine

Don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me
'Cause you might fuck around and find your dreams come true with me
Spend all your time and your money just to find out that my love was free
So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
It's not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me"
245,Roar,Katy Perry,"I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sat quietly, agreed politely
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything
You held me down, but I got up (Hey)
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up (Hey)
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Stinging like a bee, I earned my stripes
I went from zero, to my own hero

You held me down, but I got up (Hey)
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up (Got up)
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now

Hey! Where's the drums?
Woo, oh-oh-oh (Let's go!)

Ooh, girl, you're shining like a 5th Avenue diamond
And they don't make you like they used to, you're never going out of style
Ooh, pretty baby, this world might have gone crazy
The way you saved me, who could blame me when I just wanna make you smile?

I wanna thrill you like Michael
I wanna kiss you like Prince
Let's get it on like Marvin Gaye, like Hathaway
Write a song for you like this

You're over my head, I'm out of my mind
Thinking I was born in the wrong time
One of a kind, living in a world gone plastic

Baby, you're so classic (Yeah, yeah, so classic)
Baby, you're so classic (Yeah, baby you)
Baby, you're so classic

Four dozen roses, anything for you to notice
All the way to serenade you, doing it Sinatra style
I'ma pick you up in a Cadillac like a gentleman bringing glamour back
Keep it real to real in the way I feel, I could walk you down the aisle

I wanna do you like Michael
I wanna kiss you like Prince
Let's get it on like Marvin Gaye, like Hathaway
Write a song for you like this

You're over my head, I'm out of my mind
Thinking I was born in the wrong time
It's love on rewind, everything is so throwback-ish
I kinda like it how ya—
Out of my league, old school chic
Like a movie star from a silver screen
You're one of a kind, living in a world gone plastic

Baby, you're so classic (Hey! Hey!)
Baby, you're so classic (So classic)
Baby, you're so classic (Classic)

Baby, you're class and baby, you're sick
I never met a girl like you ever till we met
A star in the '40s, centerfold in the '50s
Got me trippin' out like the '60s, hippies (Oh, woah, woah)
Queen of the discotheque
A '70s dream and an '80s best
Hepburn, Beyoncé, Marilyn — massive (Ah)
Girl, you're timeless, just so classic

You're over my head, I'm out of my mind (My, my, my, my mind)
Thinking I was born in the wrong time
It's love on rewind (It's love on rewind), everything is so throwback-ish
I kinda like it how ya— (Woo!)
Out of my league, old school chic

You're one of a kind, living in a world gone plastic

251,Don't,Ed Sheeran,"140 ContributorsTranslationsTürkçeItalianoDon’t LyricsWritten about a relationship Sheeran went through, “Don’t” is believed to be about Ellie Goulding, though it’s never been officially confirmed.
I met this girl late last year
She said, ""Don't you worry if I disappear""
I told her, ""I'm not really looking for another mistake""
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only lookin' for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM""
Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singin'

Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

And for a couple weeks, I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before, a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's stayin' at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missin' it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissin' him, how I was confused about
Now, she should figure it out while I'm sat here singing

Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

On my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was cryin' on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next (Get lost)
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat (Get lost)
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were stayin' on the same **** hotel floor
And I wasn't lookin' for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realised what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late, if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singin'
Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe"

I've been sat with you for most of the night
Ignorin' everybody here, we wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
I don't wanna know if you're gettin' ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close, take another step into the no-man's land
And for the longest time, lady

I need you, darling, come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin', won't you let me know?

This love is ablaze, I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then, we've got nothin' to say and nothin' to know
But somethin' to drink and maybe somethin' to smoke
Let it go until our roads are changed
Singin' ""We Found Love"" in a local rave
No, I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out and then just hope and pray
I told her my name and said, ""It's nice to meet ya""
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know she's a keeper just from this one small act of kindness
I'm in deep **** if anybody finds out
I meant to drive home but I've drunk all of it now
Not soberin' up, we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another, now, she's kissin' my mouth

I need you, darling, come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin', won't you let me know?
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh
If you love me, come on, get involved
Feel it rushin' through you from your head to toe

Before the beat kicks in again?
Can you feel it?

Let's light it up like it's our last night

We're just hanging around
Burnin' it down
Sippin' on some cold Jack Daniel's
Jammin' to some old Alabama with you baby
Laying right here naked in my bed
I'm just doing my thing
You love it when I sing
Say it makes you feel like an angel
We about to get a little tangled up right about now
So girl let's keep burnin' it down
Burnin' it down, burnin' it down

Girl when you want it
You know that I'm on it
You know that I love lovin' up on you
Let's hit the switch and let our shadows dance
And light it up like it's our last chance

We're just hanging around
Burnin' it down
Sippin' on some cold Jack Daniel's
Jammin' to some old Alabama with you baby
Laying right here dreamin' in my bed
I'm just doing my thing
You love it when I sing
Say it makes you feel like an angel
We about to get a little tangled up right about now
So girl let's keep burnin' it down
Burnin' it down, burnin' it down, burnin' it down
Burnin' it down, burnin' it down, burnin' it down

I wanna rock it all night
Baby girl will you rock it out with me (with me)
I wanna crawl through the dark
Just to feel your heartbeat against me (against me)
I wanna rock it all night
Baby girl will you rock it out with me (with me)
I wanna crawl through the dark
Just to feel your heartbeat against me  (against me)

We're just hanging around
Burnin' it down
Sippin' on some cold Jack Daniel's
Jammin' to some old Alabama with you baby
Laying right here naked in my bed
I'm just doing my thing
You love it when I sing
Say it makes you feel like an angel
We about to get a little tangled up right about now
So girl let's keep burnin' it down
Burnin' it down, burnin' it down, burnin' it down
Burnin' it down, burnin' it down, burnin' it down

I wanna rock it all night
Baby girl will you rock it out with me (with me)
I wanna crawl through the dark
Just to feel your heartbeat against me"
263,Play It Again,Luke Bryan,"She was sittin' all alone over on the tailgate
Tan legs swingin' by a Georgia plate
I was lookin' for her boyfriend
Thinkin', ""no way, she ain't got one""
Soon as I sat down, I was fallin' in love
Tryin' to pour a little sugar in her Dixie cup
Talkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck
She jumped up and cut me off

She was like, ""Oh my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is""
She was like, ""Come here, boy, I wanna dance""
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' me around 'til it faded out
And she gave me a kiss
And she said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again""
And I said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again""

I'da gave that DJ my last dime
If he would have played it just one more time
But a little while later
We were sittin' in the drive in my truck
Before I walked her to the door
I was scannin' like a fool; AM, FM, XM too
But I stopped real quick when I heard that groove
Man, you should have seen her light up

She was like, ""Oh my God, this is my song
We've been listenin' to the radio all night long
I can't believe that it came back on, but here it is""
She was like, ""Come here boy, I wanna dance""
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights, she gave me a goodnight kiss
And I said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again""
And she said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again""

The next Friday night we were sittin' out under the stars
You should have seen her smile when I broke out my guitar

She was like, ""Oh my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is""
She was like, ""Come here boy, I wanna dance""
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights, she gave me a goodnight kiss
And she said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again""
And I said, ""Play it again, play it again, play it again""

Yeah, play it again, play it again, play it again
Somebody play it again, play it again, play it again"

Money, money, money, weed, fashion
Draped up and dripped out, keep the trees passing
Girl toot that thing up, fuck me, fuck rapping
Days of our lives so clap, clap that cake
Spreading your thighs I pump, pump your brakes, ay
Just give me the trees and we can smoke it ya
Just give me the drink and we can pour it ya
And my enemies, they see me living now
And if you roll with me, then you'll be winning now, oh

265,Dirt,Florida Georgia Line,"I'll tell you something, 1968 was just another year, the fields needed tilling and there wasn't enough rain. But it was the first year Rosie started bringing my lunch out to the field every day

You get your hands in it
Plant your roots in it
Dusty headlight, dance with your boots in it (Dirt)
You write her name on it
Spin your tires on it
Build your corn field, whiskey, bonfires on it (Dirt)
You bet your life on it, yeah
It's that...

Elm shade, red rust clay you grew up on
That plowed up ground, that your dad damned his luck on
That post game party field you circle up on
And when it rains you get stuck on
Drift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up
And mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up
Her blue-eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts
Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt

Rosie and I had five children, one died at birth, they were tough times, tough years, did okay

You've mixed some sweat with it
Taking a shovel to it
You've stuck some crosses and some painted
Goal posts through it (Dirt)
You know you came from it (Dirt)
And some day you'll return to...

Elm shade, red rust clay you grew up on
That plowed up ground, that your dad damned his luck on
That post game party field you circle up on
And when it rains you get stuck on
Drift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up
And mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up
Her blue-eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts
Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt

I asked Rosie one time if she wanted to travel to see the world, and no she said ""the world comes right to my window every day""... Even if it's broken
(You know you came from it (dirt, dirt) And some day you'll return to)

Elm shade, red rust clay you grew up on
That plowed up ground, that your dad damned his luck on
That post game party field you circle up on
And when it rains, you get stuck on
Drift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up
And mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up
Her blue-eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts
Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt

Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt

See Rosie was right about two things: you don't have to see the world to be worldly, just raise good children, bake good enough pies and the world will come right to your kitchen window. She's right about something else too, I built that baseball diamond way too close to the kitchen

(You know you came from it
And some day, you'll return to it)"

And we'll start a fire, and we'll shut it down
Till the love runs out, till the love runs out

There's a maniac out in front of me
Got an angel on my shoulder, and Mephistopheles
But Mama raised me good, Mama raised me right
Mama said, ""Do what you want, say prayers at night""
And I'm saying them 'cause I'm so devout
Till the love runs out, till the love runs out, yeah

I got my mind made up, man, I can't let go
I'm killing every second till it saves my soul

Ooh-woah, we all run for something
Run for God, for fate, for love, for hate
For gold and rust, for diamonds or dust
I'll be your light, your match, your burning sun
I'll be the bright in black that's makin' you run

I got my mind made up, man, I can't let go
I'm killing every second till it saves my soul
Woo, I'll be running, woo, I'll be running
Till the love runs out, till the love runs out
And we'll start a fire, and we'll shut it down
Till the love runs out, till the love runs out

I'll be your light, your match, your burning sun
I'll be the bright in black that's makin' you run
And we'll feel alright, and we'll feel alright
'Cause we'll work it out, yes, we'll work it out
And we'll start a fire, and we'll shut it down
Till the love runs out, till the love runs out
Till the love runs out"

Pull into the party like ""Y'all wassup?""

269,Me and My Broken Heart,Rixton,"69 ContributorsTranslationsTürkçeItalianoMe and My Broken Heart LyricsThe song “Me and My Broken Heart” takes most of its melody from the 2005 Rob Thomas song “Lonely No More”, though with different lyrics.
It was the 5th track on their debut album, Let the Road (2014).
All I need's a little love in my life
All I need's a little love in the dark
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start
Me and my broken heart
I need a little loving tonight
Hold me so I'm not falling apart
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start
Me and my broken heart, yeah

Shotgun, aimed at my heart, you got one
Tear me apart and then some
How do we call this love? (Woah-oh-oh-oh)
I tried to run away but your eyes
Tell me to stay, oh why
Why do we call this love? (Woah-oh-oh-oh)

It seems like we've been losing control
Somebody tell me I'm not alone
When I say

All I need's a little love in my life
All I need's a little love in the dark
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start
Me and my broken heart
I need a little loving tonight
Hold me so I'm not falling apart
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start
Me and my broken heart (Ah)

Maybe some part of you just hates me
You pick me up and play me
How do we call this love? (Woah-oh-oh-oh)
One time, tell me you need me tonight
To make it easy, you lie
And say it's all for love (Woah-oh-oh-oh)

It seems like we've been losing control
Somebody tell me I'm not alone
When I say

All I need's a little love in my life
All I need's a little love in the dark
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start
Me and my broken heart
I need a little loving tonight
Hold me so I'm not falling apart
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start
Me and my broken heart

Woah-oh, woah-oh
Me and my broken heart
Woah-oh, woah-oh
Me and my broken—

Yeah, yeah, yeah (Me and my broken—, broke this love)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (How do we call this?)
It's just me, it's just me, it's just me
Me and my broken heart

All I need's a little love in my life (Baby)
All I need's a little love in the dark
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start
Me and my broken heart
I need a little loving tonight
Hold me so I'm not falling apart
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start
Me and my broken heart"

Pickin’ us up by a barbed wire fence

We were Jesus saved me, blue jean baby
Born in the USA

Makin’ out on living room couches
Blowin’ that smoke on a Saturday night
A little messed up, but we’re all alright

Take her home and give her your jacket
Makin’ it to second base, but sayin’ you went all the way
Monday afternoon at practice
Sister's got a boyfriend Daddy doesn’t like
Now he’s sittin’ out back, .30-.30 in his lap
In the blue bug zapper light

273,Brave,Sara Bareilles,"You can be amazing
You can turn a phrase into a weapon or a drug
You can be the outcast
Or be the backlash of somebody's lack of love
Or you can start speaking up
Nothing's gonna hurt you the way that words do
When they settle 'neath your skin
Kept on the inside and no sunlight
Sometimes a shadow wins
But I wonder what would happen if you

Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave

I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I wanna see you be brave
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I wanna see you be brave

Everybody's been there
Everybody's been stared down by the enemy
Fallen for the fear
And done some disappearing, bow down to the mighty
Don't run, stop holding your tongue
Maybe there’s a way out of the cage where you live
Maybe one of these days, you can let the light in
And show me, how big your brave is

Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave

And since your history of silence
Won't do you any good
Did you think it would?
Let your words be anything but empty
Why don't you tell them the truth?

Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave

I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I wanna see you be brave
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
See you be brave

I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you"
274,Sweater Weather,The Neighbourhood,"And all I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach, but I stand
In California with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater, let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds, but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high-waisted shorts, oh

She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no

'Cause it's too cold for you here and now
So let me hold both your hands in the holes of my sweater

And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides a mind
To move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue 'cause you love the taste, yeah
These hearts adore
Everyone the other beats hardest for
Inside, this place is warm
Outside, it starts to pour

Comin' down
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothin' that I wouldn't wanna tell you about
No, no, no

'Cause it's too cold for you here and now
So let me hold both your hands in the holes of my sweater
'Cause it's too cold for you here and now
So let me hold both your hands in the holes of my sweater
Woah

Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah

'Cause it's too cold for you here and now
So let me hold both your hands in the holes of my sweater
'Cause it's too cold for you here and now
Let me hold both your hands in the holes of my sweater

And it's too cold, it's too cold
The holes of my sweater"

Hunt co-wrote all ten tracks on the album, which was produced by Zach Crowell and Shane McAnally.
They roll the sidewalks in this town, all up after the sun goes down
They say nothin' good happens here when midnight rolls around
But layin' down would be in vain, I can't sleep with you on my brain
And I ain't anywhere close to tired
Your kiss has got me wired

Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
High on your love has got me buzzin' like a streetlight
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally again? (Woo-hoo)
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane
The sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old Train
We'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind
We don't have to go home, we can leave the night on
But we can leave the night on (Yeah, yeah)

Now all the stars are turnin' blue, just kissed the clock 2:22
Baby, I know what you're wishin' for, I'm wishin' for it too
Now all the lights are flashin' gold, nobody cares how fast we go
Our soundtrack's in the stereo
The DJ's on a roll

Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
High on your love has got me buzzin' like a streetlight
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally again?
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane
The sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old Train
We'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind
We don't have to go home, we can leave the night on
We can leave the night on

The sun'll steal the magic from us soon
So let's take one more trip around the moon

Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
High on your love has got me buzzin' like a streetlight
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally?
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane
The sky is dropping Jupiter all around us like some old Train
We'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind (Woo-hoo)
We don't have to go home, we can leave the night on
We can leave the night on
We can leave the night on

Buzzin' like a streetlight
We can leave 'em on tonight"

278,Drunk on a Plane,Dierks Bentley,"I took two weeks vacation for the honeymoon
A couple tickets all inclusive down in Cancun
I couldn't get my money back so I'm in seat 7A
I'm getting drunk on a plane
I bet the fella on the aisle thought I was crazy
Cause I taped your picture to the seatback right beside me
Now I've got empty mini bottles fillin' both our trays
I'm getting drunk on a plane

Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737 rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane

We had this date marked on the calendar forever
We'd take that new wed limo airport ride together
I feel like a plastic groom alone there at the top of the cake
So hey, I'm getting drunk on a plane

Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737
Rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane

On my way home I'll bump this seat right up to first class
So I can drink that cheap champagne out of a real glass
And when we land I'll call her up and tell her kiss my ass
Cause hey, I'm drunk on a plane

Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737
Rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane

I'm getting drunk on a plane
I might be passed out
In the baggage claim
But right now
I'm drunk on a plane"

8 o'clock on Friday night, I'm still at home
All my girls just keep on blowin' up my phone
Sayin', ""Come on, he ain't worth the pain
Do what you gotta do to forget his name""
Now there's only one thing left for me to do
Slip on my favorite dress and sky-high leather boots
Check the mirror one last time
And kiss the past goodbye

What I'm really needin' now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
'Til I don't remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise, in the lights
Hey, bartender, pour 'em hot tonight
'Til the party and the music and the truth collide
Bring it 'til his memory fades away
Hey, bartender

Tonight I'll let a stranger pull me on the floor
Spin me 'round and let him buy a couple more
But before it goes too far
I’'l let him down easy
'Cause tonight it's all about dancin' with my girls to the DJ
Put that song on replay

What I'm really needin' now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
'Til I don’t remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise, in the lights
Hey, bartender, pour 'em hot tonight
'Til the party and the music and the truth collide
Bring it 'til his memory fades away
Hey, bartender

I'm feelin' that buzz, I'm ready to rock
Ain't no way I'm gonna tell you to stop
So pour that thing up to the top
I'm comin' in hot
Hey, bartender
Ooh-ooh-ooh, oh-oh-oh

What I'm really needin' now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
'Til I don't remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise, in the lights
Hey bartender, pour 'em hot tonight
'Til the party and the music and the truth collide
Bring it 'til his memory fades away
Hey, bartender
Hey, bartender"

284,Can't Remember to Forget You,Shakira,"68 ContributorsTranslationsΕλληνικάTürkçeEspañol한국어 (Korean)Can’t Remember to Forget You Lyrics
And I left a note on my bedpost
Saying not to repeat yesterday’s mistakes
What I tend to do when it comes to you
I see only the good, selective memory

The way you make me feel, yeah, you got a hold on me
I never met someone so different, oh, here we go
You're part of me now, you're part of me
So where you go, I follow, follow, follow (Oh)

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
I can't remember to forget you
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
I keep forgetting I should let you go
But when you look at me
The only memory is us kissing in the moonlight
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
I can't remember to forget you

Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
I can't remember to forget you
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

I go back again, fall off the train
Land in his bed, repeat yesterday’s mistakes
What I'm tryna say is not to forget
You see only the good, selective memory

The way he makes me feel like, the way he makes me feel
I never seemed to act so stupid, oh, here we go
He a part of me now, he a part of me
So where he goes, I follow, follow, follow (Oh)

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
I can't remember to forget you
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
I keep forgetting I should let you go
But when you look at me
The only memory is us kissing in the moonlight (Oh)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh (Oh, oh)
I can't remember to forget you

I rob and I kill to keep him with me
I'll do anything for that boy
I'd give my last dime to hold him tonight
I'll do anything for that boy
I rob and I kill to keep him with me
I'll do anything for that boy
I'd give my last dime to hold him tonight
I'll do anything for that boy

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
I can't remember to forget you
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
I keep forgetting I should let you go
But when you look at me
The only memory is us kissing in the moonlight (Oh)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh (Oh, oh)
I can't remember to forget you
But when you look at me
The only memory is us kissing in the moonlight (Oh)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh (Oh, oh)
I can't remember to forget you"
285,Amnesia,5 Seconds of Summer,"I drove by all the places we used to hang out getting wasted
I thought about our last kiss, how it felt, the way you tasted
And even though your friends tell me you're doin' fine
Are you somewhere feeling lonely, even though he's right beside you?
When he says those words that hurt you, do you read the ones I wrote you?

Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?
'Cause I'm not fine at all

I remember the day you told me you were leavin'
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind, you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape
'Cause I'm not fine at all

The pictures that you sent me, they're still livin' in my phone
I'll admit I like to see them, I'll admit I feel alone
And all my friends keep asking why I'm not around
It hurts to know you're happy, yeah, it hurts that you moved on
It's hard to hear your name when I haven't seen you in so long

It's like we never happened, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?
'Cause I'm not fine at all

I remember the day you told me you were leavin'
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind, you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape

If today I woke up with you right beside me
Like all of this was just some twisted dream
I'd hold you closer than I ever did before
And you'd never slip away
And you'd never hear me say

I remember the day you told me you were leavin'
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind, you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape
'Cause I'm not fine at all

No, I'm really not fine at all
Tell me this is just a dream
'Cause I'm really not fine at all"
286,No Mediocre,T.I.,"99 ContributorsNo Mediocre Lyrics“No Mediocre” is T.I.’s and Iggy Azalea’s call to always strive for the best; this includes everything from shoes to glasses to vacation spots.
All I fuck bad bitches, I don't want no mediocre ho
Don't want no mediocre, I don't want no mediocre, no!
Bad bitches only, ain't no mediocre ho
Don't want no mediocre, I won't hit no mediocre, yeah
Bad bitch stuntin' on them mediocre hoes
On them mediocre, you stunt on them mediocre
7, bitches with me and ain't none of them mediocre
From they head to they toes they so far from mediocre

Right hand in the air, I solemnly swear
I never fuck a bitch if she don’t do her hair, no more
You won’t get no dick if it’s a bush down there
Girl, I should see nothing but pussy when I look down there
Hey, come fuck with a nigga, what better to do?
He call and ask how you doin, tell him ""Better than you"", yeah
I’m kicked back with four pieces like a Kit Kat
Me fucking if you ain’t a dime, just forget that
Pretty face, fat ass, if she don’t have
Have one of these, well, I think I’ll pass
I just handed her the keys to a new drop Jag
When she took it, I took it back, you shoulda asked for a Benz
That’s mediocre bitch!

All I fuck bad bitches, I don't want no mediocre ho
Don't want no mediocre, I don't want no mediocre, no!
Bad bitches only, ain't no mediocre ho
Don't want no mediocre, I won't hit no mediocre, yeah
Bad bitch stuntin' on them mediocre hoes
On them mediocre, you stunt on them mediocre
7, bitches with me and ain't none of them mediocre
From they head to they toes they so far from mediocre

Heard he want to lay it down on Iggy Iggy
Gave it to him twice, now he want a 3, Mike Bibby
Diva, but I need a bad boy, rest in peace, Whitney
Pardon me but I don’t think none of these bitches fucking with me
Want a billboard bitch? Stop running in place
Heels on me saying gimme 6 inches of space
Courtside while designer frames cover my face
Now everybody in the game wanna get 'em a taste
I’m still Grand Hustle first lady, fuck you pay me
Bet he won't go 12 rounds with the million dollar baby
I can change your life quick, stop playing with me
And if you ain't talking money what you saying to me? Iggs

All I fuck bad bitches, I don't want no mediocre ho
Don't want no mediocre, I don't want no mediocre, no!
Bad bitches only, ain't no mediocre ho
Don't want no mediocre, I won't hit no mediocre, yeah
Bad bitch stuntin' on them mediocre hoes
On them mediocre, you stunt on them mediocre
7, bitches with me and ain't none of them mediocre
From they head to they toes they so far from mediocre

I'm in Brazil with a bitch
Catch me in a mansion in the hills with a bitch
Get her out them tennis shoes, throw some heels on a bitch
I’m the type of nigga split a mil with a bitch
Hold up, only if she bad though
Out here trying to find someone that better than my last ho
Take her to my castle, drown her in my cash flow
Say your dick so little she can fit it in her asshole
Told me she can't ride this shit no further than a cab go
Said I got that dumb dick, she wanna be my tutor
So she give me brain, getting head on the scooter
Had sex on the beach from Bermuda up to Cuba
I done fucked a lot of dimes but I’m looking for a cuter bitch
You the shit, what she say when she got to sit
When I ain't around, give a damn who you do it with
Super thick, pretty face, ménage à veinte
20 at the same time, wanna get ya rent paid?

All I fuck bad bitches, I don't want no mediocre ho
Don't want no mediocre, I don't want no mediocre, no!
Bad bitches only, ain't no mediocre ho
Don't want no mediocre, I won't hit no mediocre, yeah
Bad bitch stuntin' on them mediocre hoes
On them mediocre, you stunt on them mediocre
7, bitches with me and ain't none of them mediocre
From they head to they toes they so far from mediocre"

Afraid to lose control
And caught up in this world

Now only this seems clear
I need to move, I need to fight
I need to lose myself tonight

Whoa, come with me now
I'm gonna take you down
Whoa, come with me now
I'm gonna show you how

I think with my heart and I move with my head
I open my mouth and it's something I've read
I've stood at this door before, I'm told
But a part of me knows that I'm growing too old
Confused what I thought with something I felt
Confuse what I feel with something that's real
I tried to sell my soul last night
Funny, he wouldn't even take a bite

Far away, I heard him say (Come with me now)
Don't delay, I heard him say (Come with me now)
Far away, I heard him say (Come with me now)
Don't delay, I heard him say (Come with me now)

Whoa, come with me now
I'm gonna take you down
Whoa, come with me now
I'm gonna show you how

Afraid to lose control

She don't love me like she say she love me
Believe me, believe me

God damn, do y'all really know who y'all fuckin' with?
Yeah, I mean you can't blame me for wonderin'
Doesn't matter, could be winter or the summer
On the road, I do One Direction numbers, I don't fuckin' miss
Yeah, Stunna and Mack know
When Wayne was gone for eight months, we put this thing up on our back
And I was snappin' off on every single track though
Collect call from the boss like where we at though
I was like, ""Hah, it's our time, nigga""
He left Rikers in a Phantom, that's my nigga
And I'll been rockin' with the team 'til Carter IX
And we YMCMB, waitin' on somebody to try us, nigga

Come on, fight these shell cases like a lawyer, nigga
Find out where you stay, and act like we found some oil, nigga
Out of duct tape so when he prayin' I ignore the nigga
All I gotta say is ""sayonara, nigga""
Drop dead gorgeous but the bitch ain't dyin' for a nigga
Where the real queens at? Shout out Capone and Noreaga
We can shoot it out and see who live to tell the story later
Diamonds in my Rollie face cannot be exfoliated
They think I'm associated, I'm the one that orchestrated
Yayo get her ass whipped, whip that ass like horses racin'
Ain't 'bout what you walk away from, it's 'bout what you walk away with
Dead Presidents, them coffins vacant
I must be doin' somethin'

I'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know a nigga that could cover for me

Rich young nigga that ain't never had to trick
Slim Thug flow but you know I like 'em thick
If she get a job at DOA, I drop her off a tip
I had to get it poppin' off the rip
I'm the one they tell yah been reppin' in the 6
Come into the city and yah niggas get to trippin'
We'll take yah to the Scarborough Bluff and drop you off a cliff
Well damn, just be happy for the man
Nirvana, Coldplay, nigga got bands
Ink from the money, got it all over my hands
Goin' out to Houston, spendin' all of my advance
V Live just took me for a cheque
""Drake you know I love you, you just took me outta debt""
Yes, right now you are lookin' at the best
Mothafuck award shows and mothafuck the press like that

Mothafuck the rest
When they jumped off the porch, I was stumblin' up the steps
I'd give what I collect before I give up my connect
It'd be a cold day in Hell, icicles made of sweat
One finger, slidin' 'cross my neck
Niggas know what that mean like they deaf
Nigga I'll fire this nina like it's her first day
On the job and the bitch overslept
Tune stay humble, nigga I'm a king
Need a horn and a drumroll
They throw mothafuckin' roses at my feet, nigga
I don't step on one rose
I'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know a nigga that can cover for me
Tape a couple kilos to the bitch stomach
She look like she got a bun in the oven from me
Preheat, believe me
All you gotta do is pay me every week
I had these bitches havin' babies every week
I'm the nigga, see me skatin' in the streets
Gone

290,Beachin',Jake Owen,"12 ContributorsBeachin’ LyricsThe song is about a guy who is hanging out and having a very fun time at the beach drinking beer with his friends, and develops an attraction towards one of his friends.
Just watching her blonde hair, sun burn, stare at them
Whitecaps rolling over
Laid back in a thrift store beach chair
Dropping limes in her Corona
Well she looks back, yeah, she throws me a kiss
Like ""Honey, I sure want you""
And it's a hundred and three between her and me
And only 92 in Daytona

And it's sunshine, blue eyes, tan lines, it's low tide
Rolling white sand, cold can koozie in my hand, just a summertime strollin'
Chillin', breezin', sippin', singin' woah a oh, oh
Beachin'

We got 2-for-1s, we're at a margarita bar
Whatever happens happens
And there's a reggae band, full of dread heads
Just sittin' in the corner laughin'
Well my baby walks over, drops a 20 in a jar
She smiles and shakes it at me
Yeah, she gets 'em going, she gets 'em playing
A little, don't worry be happy

And it's sunshine, blue eyes, tan lines, it's low tide
Rolling white sand, cold can koozie in my hand, just a summertime strollin'
Chillin', breezin', sippin', singin' woah a oh, oh
Beachin'

Ah yeah
Lil palm tree leanin'
I got a margerita in my hand, I'm doin' a little drinkin'

Talking 'bout
Sunshine, blue eyes, tan lines, it's low tide
Rolling white sand, cold can koozie in my hand, just a summertime strollin'
Chillin', breezin', sippin', singin' woah a oh, oh
Beachin' (Aw, we're just beachin')
Sunshine, blue eyes, tan lines, it's low tide (Under the palm tree leanin')
Rolling white sand, cold can koozie in my hand..."
291,White Walls,Macklemore & Ryan Lewis,"I wanna be free
I wanna just live
Inside my Cadillac
That is my shit
Now throw it up (Man throw that up)
That's what it is (That's what it is)
In my C-A-D-I-L-L-A-C, bitch (Biatch!)

Can't see me through my tints (Nuh-uh)
I'm riding real slow (Slow motion)
In my paint, wet, drippin', shinin' like my 24s (Umbrella)
I ain't got 24s (Nuh-uh)
But I'm on those Vogues (Yeah)
That's those big white walls, r-r-round them hundred spokes
Old school like Olde English in that brown paper bag
I'm rollin' in that same whip that my granddad had
Hello, haters, damn y'all mad
30k on the Caddy, now how backpack rap is that?

I got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I'm rolling that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright

Man, I'm loungin'
In some shit Bernie Mac would've been proud of
Lookin' down from heaven like damn that's stylish
Smilin', don't pay attention to the mileage
Can I hit the freeway? Illegally going 120
Easy weavin' in and out of the traffic
They cannot catch me, I'm smashin'
I'm duckin', buckin' them out here
I'm lookin' fuckin' fantastic, I am up in a classic
Now I know what it's like under the city lights
Ridin' into the night, drivin' over the bridge
The same one we'd walk across as kids
Knew I'd have a whip but never one like this
Old school, old school
Candy paint, two-seater
Yeah, I'm from Seattle, there's hella Honda Civics
I couldn't tell you about paint either
But I really wanted a Caddy so I put in the hours
And rolled on over to the dealer
And I found the car I dreamed of, placed a bargain with this geezer
Got the keys in, as I was leavin' I started screamin'

I got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I'm rolling that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright

Yeah, uh
Backwoods and dope
White hoes in the backseat snortin' coke
She doing line after line like she's writing rhymes
I had her inhalin' my love, tryna blow her mind
Cadillac pimpin', my uncle was on
14, I stole his keys, me and my niggas was gone
Stealing portions of his liquor, water in his Patron
Drivin', smilin' like I won the fucking lottery homes
(Fuckin' lottery homes)
Tires with the spokes on it, and the Vogues too
Mustard and mayonnaise, keepin' the buns all on
My dogs hangin' out the window
Young as whoosh, fuckin' like we ball
Tryna fuck 'em all
Never park the whip, see what's poppin' at the mall
Meet a bad bitch, slap her booty with my paw
You can smoke the pussy, I was tearin' down the walls
I'm motherfuckin' awe-
-some, swear these sights tryna hypnotize
Grip the leather steerin' wheel while I grip the thighs
See the lust stuck up in her eyes
Maybe she like the ride or did she like the smoke?
Or does she want it low?
'Cause this shit a Coupe de Ville so you'll never know
So we cruise for minutes, my nigga fuck the limit
Got a window tinted, for sure a gangsta in it
Slide 'til the gas is finished, Q

Off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I'm rolling that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright
Got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I'm rolling that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so, looked so bright"

Would you wanna run away too?

Give me somethin'

See me up in the club with fifty-'leven girls
Posted in the back, diamond fangs in my grill
Brooklyn brim with my eyes sittin' low
Every boy in here with me got that smoke
And every girl in here got to look me up and down
All on Instagram, cake by the pound
Circulate the image every time I come around
G's up, tell me how I'm lookin', babe

Boy, this all for you, just walk my way
Just tell me how it's lookin', babe
Just tell me how it's lookin', babe (How it's lookin', babe)

High like treble, pumpin' on the mids
The man ain't ever seen a booty like this
And why you think you keep my name rollin' off the tongue?
'Cause when he wanna smash, I'll just write another one
I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker

All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man, it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker, that's my nigga

She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant, they ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough, I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run the game in these, man, the seams are splittin'
No pun intended, but they smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man, we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
'Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, for real

Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up"

Pulled up to the church but I got so nervous
Had to back it on up, couldn't make it to the service
Grabbed all the cash underneath my mattress
Got a real good feeling somethin' bad about to happen

Ran into a girl in a pretty white dress
Rolled down a window
Where you headed to next?
Said I'm heading to the bar with my money out of the mattress
Got a real good feeling somethin' bad about to happen

We're rollin' down the road, down to New Orleans
Got a full tank of gas and the money out of the mattress

Bout to tear it up down in New Orleans
Just like a real-life Thelma and Louise
If the cops catch up, they're gonna call it kidnapping
Got a real good feelin' somethin' bad about to happen

Stand on the bar, stomp your feet, start clapping

301,Thinking Out Loud,Ed Sheeran,"When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darlin', I will be lovin' you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three

And I'm thinkin' 'bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me, I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

So honey, now, take me into your lovin' arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
And place your head on my beatin' heart, I'm thinkin' out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mmm
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory

I'm thinkin' 'bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Oh, I'll just keep on makin' the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

That, baby, now, take me into your lovin' arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beatin' heart, I'm thinkin' out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are, oh-oh

Lo-lo-lo, lo-lo-lo
Lo-lo-lo, lo-lo-lo, love

So baby, now, take me into your lovin' arms
And kiss me under the light of a thousand stars, oh, darlin'
Place your head on my beatin' heart, I'm thinkin' out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh, maybe we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are"

Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standin' right here talkin' to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But somethin' told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place
Uh

How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standin' there by my side

Oh, oh
Ooh (Yeah)
First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feelin' strong
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond'll never be broken, the love will never get lost
And when brotherhood come first, then the line'll never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone

How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standin' there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

Just keep your eyes on me""
I said, ""You're holding back""
She said, ""Shut up and dance with me""
This woman is my destiny
She said, ooh-ooh, shut up and dance with me

We were victims of the night
The chemical, physical kryptonite
Helpless to the bass and the fading light
Oh, we were bound to get together
Bound to get together
She took my arm
I don't know how it happened
We took the floor and she said

""Oh, don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me""
I said, ""You're holding back""
She said, ""Shut up and dance with me""
This woman is my destiny
She said, ooh-ooh, shut up and dance with me

A backless dress and some beat-up sneaks
My discothèque Juliet, teenage dream
I felt it in my chest as she looked at me
I knew we were bound to be together
Bound to be together
She took my arm
I don't know how it happened
We took the floor and she said

""Oh, don't you dare look back

I said, ""You're holding back""
She said, ""Shut up and dance with me""
This woman is my destiny
She said, ooh-ooh, shut up and dance with me

Oh, c'mon, girl

Deep in her eyes
I think I see the future
I realize this is my last chance

306,Blank Space,Taylor Swift,"Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
""Oh, my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?"" Ayy
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So, hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh, no
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing, like
""Oh, my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless (Oh)
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless (Oh-oh), mm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane (Insane)
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya

So it's gonna be forever

313,Take Me to Church,Hozier,"My lover's got humour
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's gettin' more bleak
A fresh poison each week
We were born sick, you heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, ""Worship in the bedroom""
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well

A, amen
Amen, amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life

If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
Drain the whole sea, get somethin' shiny
Somethin' meaty for the main course
That's a fine lookin' high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starvin' faithful
That looks tasty, that looks plenty
This is hungry work

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life

No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then, I am human, only then, I am clean

Oh, oh, amen
Amen, amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife

Salt in the wound like you're laughin' right at me

Think about the good times
You and I

'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood, hey

Did you think we'd be fine?
Still got scars on my back from your knife
So don't think it's in the past
These kinda wounds, they last and they last
Now, did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal, but this won't
So if you're comin' my way, just don't

Te rappelles-tu, il n'y a pas fort longtemps
Nous marchions sur le trottoir
Innocent, te souviens-tu?
Tout ce que nous faisions était prendre soin l'un de
L'autre
Mais la nuit était chaude
Nous étions audacieux et jeunes
Tout autour le vent souffle
Nous nous accrochions seulement pour lâcher prise

Soufflez un baiser, mettez le feu aux armes
Nous avons besoin de quelqu'un sur qui compter
Soufflez un baiser, mettez le feu aux armes
Tout ce dont nous avons besoin c'est quelqu'un sur qui
Compter
Soufflez un baiser, mettez le feu aux armes
Nous avons besoin de quelqu'un sur qui compter
Soufflez un baiser, mettez le feu aux armes
Tout ce dont nous avons besoin c'est quelqu'un sur qui
Compter

Que ferons-nous lorsque nous vieillirons ?
Marcherons-nous encore dans la même voie ?
Seras-tu là à mes côtés ?
Debout et fort alors que les vagues se retournent
Quand les nuits sont longues
Je désir ardemment que tu viennes à la maison
Tout autour le vent souffle
Nous nous tiendrons seulement juste pour lâcher prise

Soufflez un baiser, mettez le feu aux armes
Nous avons besoin de quelqu'un sur qui compter
Soufflez un baiser, mettez le feu aux armes
Tout ce dont nous avons besoin c'est quelqu'un sur qui
Compter
Soufflez un baiser, mettez le feu aux armes
Nous avons besoin de quelqu'un sur qui compter
Soufflez un baiser, mettez le feu aux armes
Tout ce dont nous avons besoin c'est quelqu'un sur qui
Compter
Tout ce dont nous avons besoin c'est quelqu'un sur qui
Compter
(Soufflez un baiser, mettez le feu aux armes)
Tout ce dont nous avons besoin c'est quelqu'un sur qui
Compter
Compter, compter, compter, compter...

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

Soufflez un baiser, mettez le feu aux armes
Nous avons besoin de quelqu'un sur qui compter
Soufflez un baiser, mettez le feu aux armes

I gave you the key when the door wasn't open, just admit it
See, I gave you faith, turned your doubt into hoping, can’t deny it
Now I'm all alone and my joys turned to moping
Tell me, where are you now that I need you? Where are you now?

Where are you now that I need ya? Couldn't find you anywhere
When you broke down, I didn't leave ya, I was by your side
So where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?

Where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?

I gave you attention when nobody else was payin'
I gave you the shirt off my back, what you sayin'? To keep you warm
I showed you the game everybody else was playin', that's for sure
And I was on my knees when nobody else was prayin', oh Lord

Where are you now that I need ya? Couldn't find you anywhere
When you broke down, I didn't leave ya, I was by your side
So where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?

Where are you now?"

Creo que he tenido suficiente
Podría emborracharme un poco
Digo lo que tengo en mente
Podría hacer un poco de tiempo
Porque toda mi amabilidad
Es tomada por debilidad

Ahora estoy a cuatro, cinco segundos de explotar
Y tenemos tres días más hasta el Viernes
Solo estoy tratando de regresar a casa el Lunes por la mañana
Te juro que desearía que alguien me lo dijera
Oh, еso es todo lo que quiero

Dеspertó un optimista
El sol brillaba, estoy positivo
Nosotros podemos correr
Entonces escuché que estabas hablando basura
Estoy en un misterio
Abrázame, que estoy a punto de estallar

Si, ahora estoy a cuatro, cinco segundos de explotar
Y tenemos tres días más hasta el Viernes
Solo estoy tratando de regresar a casa el Lunes por la mañana
Te juro que desearía que alguien me lo dijera
Oh, eso es todo lo que quiero

Y sé que estás despierto esta noche
Pensando, ""¿Cómo pude ser tan egoísta?""
Pero me llamaste mil veces
Preguntándome dónde he estado
Ahora sé que estás despierto esta noche
Pensando, ""¿Cómo pude ser tan imprudente?""
Pero no puedo disculparme
Espero que lo puedas entender, sí

Si voy a la cárcel esta noche
Prométeme que pagarás mi fianza
Mira que ellos quieren comprar mi orgullo
Pero eso no está a la venta
Mira toda mi amabilidad (Mhm)
Ser tomada por debilidad

Ahora estoy a cuatro, cinco segundos de explotar
Y tenemos tres días más hasta el Viernes
Solo estoy tratando de regresar a casa el Lunes por la mañana
Te juro que desearía que alguien me lo dijera
Oh, eso es todo lo que quiero
Estoy a cuatro, cinco segundos de explotar
Y tenemos tres días más hasta el Viernes
Solo estoy tratando de regresar a casa el Lunes por la mañana
Te juro que desearía que alguien me lo dijera
Porque eso es todo lo que quiero"

Watch me pull out all this dough
Take you where you want to go
Flexin' on your ex, I know

Barely even left your house
How dare that nigga run his mouth
When his pockets in a drought

Never really cared what the fuck these niggas think, ayy

Countin' all this bread, I don't talk to feds
Try and take my bitch, you gonna take two to the head

Could've walked away, but you're still here

If the pussy ain't good then I probably won't feed her
Lil homie, you can keep her cause I really don't need her
I ain't worried 'bout features, homeboy, you's a peon
Toilet seat ass nigga, man, I swear you gettin' peed on

My alarm clock set, just in case they wanna sleep on, ya dig?
I'm a full-time player, hoppin' out in alligator
Sippin' lean and Now and Later, homie, I'll annihilate ya
If you think you wanna battle, you gon' have to pay some paper

It's a shame how I'm barely gettin' love in the city
Travel to another town, you can bet they fuckin' with me

We had just come from that video
You know, L.A. traffic, how the city slow
She was sittin' down on that big butt
But I was still starin' at the titties though

I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways
My girlfriend will beat a bitch up if she wave
They bet' not fuck with her surfboard, surfboard
My eyes are so bright, I take cover for shade
Don't have my money? Take mothers instead
You got the hiccups, you swallowed the truth
Then I make you burp, boy, treat beef like sirloin
I'm talkin' 'bout runnin' in houses with army guns
So think about your son and daughter rooms
Got two hoes with me, masked up, they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' 'bout your son and daughter rooms
This shit is crazy, my nigga
I mean brazy, my nigga
That money talk, I just rephrase it, my nigga
Blood gang, take the ""B"" off behavior, my nigga
For reals, if you mouth off, I blow your face off
I mean ""pop-pop-pop,"" then I take off
Nigga, now you see me, nigga, now you don't

Sixteen in a clip, one in the chamber
17 Ward bully with seventeen bullets
My story is how I went from ""poor me""
To ""please pour me a drink and celebrate with me""

This is for the A

Shawty, I don't mind
If you dance on a pole, that don't make you a ho
Shawty, I don't mind
When you work until three, if you're leavin' with me
Go make that money, money, money
Your money, money, money
'Cause I know how it is, go and handle your biz
And get that money, money, money
Your money, money, money
You can take off your clothes, long as you comin' home
Girl, I don't mind

The ballers in here tonight, they gon' buy a hundred bottles
As soon as you shake it I know they gon' make it colossal in here
'Cause shawty, you thinkin' them tricks that you do with your body
Got all of these niggas, they crowdin' around you like they seen Beyoncé in here (she here, she here!)
You want your own and you need your own, baby, who am I to judge?
'Cause how could I ever trip about it when I met you in the club?
I make enough for the both of us, but you dance anyway
You know I was raised in the A

Shawty, I don't mind
If you dance on a pole, that don't make you a ho
Shawty, I don't mind
When you work until three, if you're leavin' with me
Go make that money, money, money

And get that money, money, money
Your money, money, money
You can take off your clothes, long as you comin' home
Girl, I don’t mind

When you get off of work I'll be ready to go in the 'Rari
And when we get home we'll have us our own private party in here
So I don’t worry at all about the things they do or say
I love you anyway
You can twerk while in a split, you rackin' up them tips
Your body rock and your booty poppin', I'm proud to call you my bitch
They'd be lookin', but they can't touch you, shawty, I’m the only one to get it
So just go ahead and keep doin' what you're doin'

Shawty, I don't mind
If you dance on a pole, that don't make you a ho
Shawty, I don't mind
When you work until three, if you're leavin' with me
Go make that money, money, money

You can take off your clothes, long as you comin' home
Girl, I don't mind

(It's ya boy, Juicy J)
I’m just tryna cut her up, tryna bust a nut
Tryna take somebody bitch, turn her to a slut
Tryna fill my cup, tryna live it up
Throw some hundreds on that ass, walk her out the club
(Yeah, ho) Lap dance for the first date
Bet I threw a few bands, that’s third base
It’s okay if you work late
We can still party like it’s your birthday
We can still party hard in your birthday suit
Knock that pussy out the park like my name Babe Ruth
Shawty she just want a tip, I just want to see her strip
If you fuck me like you love me shawty you might get rich
Have her own cake, her own place
Blow her own gas, no Rolaid
When we in the bed she like to roleplay
Tell her friend to join in both ways

Shawty, I don't mind
If you dance on a pole, that don't make you a ho
Shawty, I don't mind
When you work until three, if you're leavin' with me
You gotta make that money, money, money

Bilmem gereken bir şey söyle
Sonra nefesimi al ve asla bırakma
Eğer alanını işgal etmeme izin verirsen
Acıyla birlikte, bundan zevk alacağım

Ve eğer o anda, hazzı yaşarsam*
Bebeğim, o anda, bunun bizden daha büyük bir şey olduğunu
Ve mutluluğun ötesinde olduğunu anlayacaksın
Buna inanmam için bana bir sebep ver

Çünkü benimle olmak istiyorsan
Beni daha çok, çok, daha çok
Daha çok sevmelisin
Ve eğer bana gerçekten ihtiyacın varsa
Beni daha çok, çok, daha çok
Daha çok sеvmelisin (Da-daha çok sevmelisin)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Daha çok, daha çok, daha çok
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Sеv beni, sev beni, sev beni

Senin nedenlerini biliyorum ve sen de benimkileri biliyorsun
Beni sevenleri geride bırakma eğilimindeyim
Eğer beni tanıyor ve kalmayı seçiyorsan
O halde bu zevki hisset ve acıyla buna katlan

Ve eğer o anda azarsan
Seni inlettiğimde, bunun gerçek olduğunu biliyorsun
Kalçalarının arasındaki baskıyı hissedebiliyor musun?
İlk seferinmiş gibi hissettireceğim

Çünkü benimle olmak istiyorsan
Beni daha çok, çok, daha çok
Daha çok sevmelisin (Seni daha çok seviyorum, hey!)
Ve eğer bana gerçekten ihtiyacın varsa
Beni daha çok, çok, daha çok
Daha çok sevmelisin (Sev beni, bebeğim, sev beni) (Da-daha çok sevmelisin)

Sev beni, sev beni, sev beni (Oh)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Daha çok, daha çok, daha çok

Peki bunun nedenini bulamazsam ne yapacağım? (Bunu halledemezsem)
Çabalamalısın, tekrar, tekrar, tekrar çabalamalısın (Oh whoa)
Peki bunun nedenini bulamazsam ne yapacağım? (Bunu halledemezsem)
Senden tekrar ayrılacağım

Çünkü benimle olmak istiyorsan (Hey!)
Beni daha çok, çok, daha çok
Daha çok sevmelisin (Seni seviyorum, seviyorum, aşkım)
Ve eğer bana gerçekten ihtiyacın varsa (Ooh)
Beni daha çok, çok, daha çok
Daha çok sevmelisin (Beni sevmelisin, bebeğim)
Çünkü benimle olmak istiyorsan (Hey)
Beni daha çok, çok, daha çok
Daha çok sevmelisin (Beni daha çok sev, daha çok sev)

Beni daha çok, çok, daha çok (Seni severim, yaparım, severim)

And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothin' lasts forever

He's so bad, but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request is

You got me sipping on something
I can't compare to nothing I've ever known
I'm hoping that after this fever I'll survive
I know I'm acting a bit crazy
Strung out, a little bit hazy
Hand over heart, I'm praying
That I'm gonna make it out alive

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

You got me scattered in pieces
Shining like stars and screaming
Lighting me up like Venus
But then you disappear and make me wait
And every second's like torture
Heroin drip, no more so
Finding a way to let go
Baby, baby, no, I can't escape

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

This is a modern fairytale
No happy endings, no wind in our sails
But I can't imagine a life without
Breathless moments
Breaking me down, down, down, down

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

That one day I will be where I was
Right there, right next to you
And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
The moon, the stars are nothing without you
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
No words can explain the way I'm missing you
Deny this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside
These tears, they tell their own story

Told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong

Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
And make sure you're all right?
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

I'm reaching out to you
Can you hear my call? (Who's to say you won't hear me?)
This hurt that I've been through
I'm missing you, missing you like crazy

You told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong

Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
And make sure you're all right?
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side
Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side

Can I lay by your side, next to you? You"

Them shows is back-to-back to back now
Put the world on our sound
You know PARTY and The Weeknd
Ain't got no motherfuckin' time
To party on the weekend
Tell Gelo bring the juice
We about to get lit
Fill the room up with some tings
One night off and this is it
Always workin' OT
Overtime and out of town
Shit is crazy back home
It kills me that I'm not around
I think we gettin' too deep
Shit I'm talkin' might be too true
Upstairs I got Xans in an Advil bottle
I don't take them shits but you do
So I got 'em for you
I don't need the pills
I'm just gon' have another drink
And when I'm puttin' work in on a weekend
I'll look back on this and think

Workin' Monday night
On the corner flippin' hard
Made at least three thousand
On the boulevard
I've been workin' graveyard
Shifts every other weekend
Ain't got no fuckin' time
To party on the weekend
I've been flippin' in the house
Makin' juggs on the highway
I've been ridin' out of state
Makin' money like my way
I don't think that I should dance
I'm just gon' have another drink
I'm doin' my stance
You know my molly pink
I got the loudest of the loud
You know my gas stink
My P.O. think I'm in the house
Don't give a damn 'bout what she think

Got the club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey

I don't think that I should stay
You know I gotta go
Been moving too fast
Don't wanna take it slow

Got the club goin' up on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up on a Tuesday

382,Hit the Quan,iLoveMemphis,"94 ContributorsHit The Quan Lyrics“Hit The Quan” is another song to first blow up on Vine and get even bigger. iHeart Memphis teaches us how to do the latest dance, the “Quan,” first originated by Atlanta rapper Rich Homie Quan.

Yeah (Yeah)
Bah, uh, yeah (Hey, Buck Nasty, I like your beat)
Ah, ayy, wait 'til they feel me (I ain't wastin' no time tonight, man)
I finna, I finna, finna show you how to

Hit the Quan, hit the Quan, hit the Quan, hit the Quan
I said get down low and swing your arm
I said get down low and hit the Quan
I'm finna show you how to
Hit the Quan, hit the Quan, hit the Quan, hit the Quan
I said get down low and swing your arm
I said get down low and hit the Quan

I paper chase, then vanish
Hit the Quan on her, make her boyfriend panic
IHeartMemphis, but I also love dancing
I done took off on 'em, I don't plan on landing
I call shots, 'Just Do It' like Nike
No FaceTime, but the people want to Skype me
If I do time, then who would really write me?
I stay on y'all mind but, ""Oh, I think they like me""
Clean pair of sneaks with a designer belt
Please watch your step, 'cause I'm feeling myself
Throw a flag on the play, man somebody get the ref
Go, ""Blah-la-la-la-low,"" man, somebody get some help
Pulled up on the block

Hit the Quan, hit the Quan, hit the Quan, hit the Quan
I said get down low and swing your arm
I said get down low and hit the Quan
I'm finna show you how to
Hit the Quan, hit the Quan, hit the Quan, hit the Quan
I said get down low and swing your arm
I said get down low and hit the Quan

Pull-Pull-Pull up on the block and do the dance like crazy
This chick is hella hot, but I know this chick crazy
If I think she not, then that makes me crazy
We are both thots so we are both are crazy
Flex-Flexing always on my agenda
Your whole team rats, your CEO is Master Splinter
'Bout to hit the Quan and turn that girl into a member
Now my whole team flexing, I think we got a winner
People want to dap it up but they can't get none from me
I went to jail and snap it up, at least I had bum money
People wanna walk around me, tryna steal my lingo
Just make sure when you talk about me, you say he's doing his thing, though

Hit the Quan, hit the Quan, hit the Quan, hit the Quan
I said get down low and swing your arm
I said get down low and hit the Quan
I'm finna show you how to
Hit the Quan, hit the Quan, hit the Quan, hit the Quan
I said get down low and swing your arm
I said get down low and hit the Quan"
383,Downtown,Macklemore & Ryan Lewis,"I went to the moped store, said ""Fuck it""
And salesman's like ""What up, what's your budget?""
And I'm like ""Honestly, I don't know nothing about mopeds""
He said ""I got the one for you, follow me""
Ooh, it's too real
Chromed out mirror, I don't need a windshield
Banana seat, a canopy on two wheels
Eight hundred cash, that's a hell of a deal
I'm headed...

Downtown, cruising through the alley
Tip-toeing in the street like ballet
Pulled up, moped to the valet
White walls on the wheels like mayonnaise
Dope, my crew is ill
And all we need is two good wheels
Got gas in the tank, cash in the bank
And a bad little mama with her ass in my face
I'ma lick that, stick that, break her off, Kit-Kat
Snuck her in backstage, you don't need a wristband
Dope

Killing the game, 'bout to catch a body
Passed the Harley, Dukie on the Ducati
Timbaland, Khaled, Scott Storch, Birdman
Goddamn, man, everybody got Bugattis
But I'ma keep it hella 1987
Head into the dealership and drop a stack and cop a Kawasaki
I'm stunting on everybody, hella raw, pass the Wasabi
I'm so low that my scrotum's almost dragging up on the concrete
My seat is leather, alright, I'm lying, it's pleather
But girl, we could still ride together, oh
You don't need an Uber, you don't need a cab
Fuck a bus pass, you got a moped, man
She got 1988 Mariah Carey hair
Very rare, mom jeans on her derriere
Throwing up the West Side as we tear in the air
Stop by Pike Place, throwing fish to a player

Downtown, downtown (Downtown)
Downtown, downtown (Downtown)
She has her arms around your waist
With a balance that will keep her safe (Downtown)
Have you ever felt the warm embrace (Downtown)
Of a leather seat between your legs
Hey, hey-oh-ey-ey
Hey, hey-oh-ey-ey
Hey, hey-oh-ey-ey
Hey, hey-oh-ey-ey

Downtown
You don't want no beef, boy
Know I run the streets, boy
Better follow me towards
Downtown
What you see is what you get, girl
Don't ever forget, girl
Ain't seen nothing yet until you're
Downtown

Dope
Cut the bullshit, get off my mullet
Stone washed, so raw, moped like a bullet
Oh, yee-ow, you can't catch me
A po-po can't reprimand me
I'm in a B-Boy stance, I'm not dancing
I got your girl on the back going tandem
Cause I'm too damn quick, I'm too damn slick
Whole downtown yelling out ""Who that is?""

It's me, the M, the A-C, the K
Sounding like a French pimp from back in the day
I take her to Pend Oreille and I water skate
I mean, water ski, ollie, ollie, oxen free
I'm perusing down Fourth and they watching me
I do a headstand, the eagle lands on my seat
Well hello, but baby, the kickstand ain't free
Now do you or do you not wanna ride with me?
I got one girl, I got two wheels
She a big girl, but ain't a big deal
I like a big girl, I like 'em sassy
Going down the backstreet listening to Blackstreet
Running around the whole town
Neighbors yelling at me like, ""You need to slow down""
""Going thirty-eight, Dan, chill the fuck out
Mow your damn lawn and sit the hell down""
If I only had one helmet, I would give it to you, give it to you
Cruising down Broadway, girl, what a wonderful view, wonderful view
There's layers to this shit, player, tiramisu, tiramisu
Let my coat-tail drag but I ain't tearing my suit, tearing my suit
Downtown, downtown (Downtown)
Downtown, downtown
She has her arms around your waist
With a balance that will keep her safe
Have you ever felt the warm embrace
Of a leather seat between your legs

Downtown
You don't want no beef, boy
Know I run the streets, boy
Better follow me towards
Downtown
What you see is what you get, girl
Don't ever forget, girl
Ain't seen nothing yet until you're
Downtown

You don't want no beef, boy
Know I run the streets, boy
Better follow me towards
Downtown
What you see is what you get, girl
Don't ever forget, girl
Ain't seen nothing yet until you're

386,Kick the Dust Up,Luke Bryan,"Kick the dust up, c'mon

All week long it’s a farmin’ town
They’re makin’ that money grow
Tractors, plows with flashing lights
Backin’ up a two lane road
They take one last lap around
That sun up high goes down
And then it's on, come on
Girl kick it on back
Z71 like a Cadillac

We go way out where
There ain’t nobody
We turn this cornfield
Into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
Eight up in a four door
Burnin’ up a back road song
Park it and we pile out
Baby, watch your step now
Better have your boots on
Kick the dust up
Back it on up
Fill your cup up
Let’s tear it up, up
And kick the dust up (kick the dust up...)

Bar downtown they got a line
Of people way out the door
$10 dollar drinks, it’s packed inside
I don’t know what they’re waitin for
Got me a jar full of clear
And I got that music for your ears
And it’s like knock, knock, knock goes the diesel
If you really wanna see the beautiful people

We go way out where
There ain’t nobody
We turn this cornfield
Into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
Eight up in a four door
Burnin’ up a back road song
Park it and we pile out
Baby, watch your step now
Better have your boots on
Kick the dust up
Let's back it on up
Fill your cup up
Let’s tear it up, up
And kick the dust up (c'mon)

Just follow me down ‘neath the 32 bridge
Y'all be glad you did (kick it)

We go way out where
There ain’t nobody
We turn this cornfield
Into a party
Pedal to the floorboard
Eight up in a four door
Burnin’ up a back road song
Park it and we pile out
Baby watch your step now
Better have your boots on
Kick the dust up
Back it on up
Fill your cup up
That’s what’s up, up
Let’s kick the dust up"

For my niggas who gon' go to Hell and back for me, I'ma give 'em Heaven on Earth
Or a hell of a check, yeah, whichever come first
Blessings on blessings on blessings
Look at my life, man, that's lessons on lessons on lessons
I treat the beat like it's a reverend
I tell the truth like, ""Father, forgive me, these are all my confessions""
Man, this wasn't luck, it was destined
I done lost homies who been with me since Ed, Edd n Eddy
Who flip like confetti
And then when you back, they back to call you ""dog,"" that shit get-get petty
Bitch, don't give no dap to me, nigga
Funny thing about talking behind my back is that it just keep comin' back to me, nigga
Was off for a sec, now it's back to me, nigga, you mad at me
This ain't what I want, man, this what it had to be
This is that late night working after 3
Man, this is why my old girl was mad at me
This why I'm your majesty
Man, the clique is the tightest, the pussy the tightest
The drinks are the coldest, the future the brightest
The fee not divided, the love is divided
And I just gotta thank God that we got it
Blessed
I don't know what I would do without it
Crew look like we robbed a bank, but all we make is deposits

I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
Way up, I feel blessed

Look, I ain't gon' say that we back or nothin'
‘Cause that implies that we're back from somethin'
If we're back from somethin', it's some checks you owe us
I expect that payment, nothing less or over
I don't need them favors that you ask me for
I could give two fucks 'bout where the Grammys go
I just gave out Grammys on my Instagram
Them OVO boys the business, man
It is what it is, trust me, you get what you give, yeah
You gotta come to my side and see how we live, yeah
I cannot see Heaven being much better than this, yeah
Blessings on blessings for me and my niggas from the 6, look at what we did, yeah
Be quiet, I'm doin' a toast
For niggas that don't really do shit, I swear y'all be doin' the most
Stop worryin' 'bout whoever's next
I am just worried 'bout my mama worryin' less
I think I'm famous enough, I don't need any more press
I am convinced I'm the only one left that's still doin' this shit, man

I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
Way up, I feel blessed

My grandma just died, I'm the man of the house
So every morning I'm up 'cause I can't let them down, down
Always down for the cause, never down for the count
I guess when your stars align, you do like the solar system and plan it out
So I'm going over time on the overtime
Yeah, I'm that invested, but you can't attest it
Million-dollar goals, managed to manifest it
The family never goin' anorexic
I pay my own mortgage and electric
Never goin' under, even with anesthetics
At the top of the rap game and progressin'
Check after check, checkin' off my checklist
Try and blow my cake, just know that's a death wish
No mistakes in life ever, it's only lessons
Shit feel like Shaq and Penny got back together
You tore the game apart, who put it back together?
I

I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
Way up, I feel blessed
Since the truth keep niggas traumatized
They tryna compromise my condom size
So I Snapchat that whole shit
Tryna see titties, tryna show dick
And I swear to God, I hope they post it, I'm blessed
Even though I get slammed with lawsuits like car doors
See three POs like Star Wars
They want me by the road holdin' up cardboard
So I go extra hard on the hard floor
Right now, I'm callin' you from my home gym
Right after that, nigga, I'm gon' swim
Just did a couple laps in my home pool
And my daughter right there gettin' homeschooled, I'm blessed
And I was thinking 'bout starting up my own school, a Montessori
And the hallway lookin' like a monastery, oh, yes
I'm way up, I feel blessed"

This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long, I forgot how to turn it
Up, up, up, up all night long
Oh, up, up all night long
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Turned it on, but I know you can take it
Up, up, up, up all night long
Oh, up, up all night long, all night long

Until tonight, I only dreamed about you
I can't believe I've ever breathed without you
Baby, you make me feel alive and brand new
Bring it one more time (One more time)

This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long, I forgot how to turn it
Up, up, up, up all night long
Oh, up, up all night long
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Turned it on, but I know you can take it
Up, up, up, up all night long
Oh, up, up all night long, all night long
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long, I forgot how to turn it
Up, up, up, up all night long
Oh, up, up all night long
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Turned it on, but I know you can take it
Up, up, up, up all night long
Oh, up, up all night long"
391,Don't,Ed Sheeran,"140 ContributorsTranslationsTürkçeItalianoDon’t LyricsWritten about a relationship Sheeran went through, “Don’t” is believed to be about Ellie Goulding, though it’s never been officially confirmed.
I met this girl late last year
She said, ""Don't you worry if I disappear""
I told her, ""I'm not really looking for another mistake""
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only lookin' for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM""
Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singin'

Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

And for a couple weeks, I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before, a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's stayin' at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missin' it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissin' him, how I was confused about
Now, she should figure it out while I'm sat here singing

Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

On my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was cryin' on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next (Get lost)
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat (Get lost)
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were stayin' on the same **** hotel floor
And I wasn't lookin' for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realised what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late, if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singin'
Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe"
392,Ghost,Ella Henderson,"I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
And at most, I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake

My friends had you figured out
Yeah, they saw what's inside of you
You tried hiding another you
But your evil was coming through
These eyes sitting on the wall
They watch every move I make
Bright light living in the shade
Your cold heart makes my spirit shake (Ooo-ohh)

I had to go through hell to prove I'm not insane
Had to meet the devil just to know his name
And that's when my love was burning
Yeah, it's still burning!

I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
And at most, I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake
I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
And at most, I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake

Each time that I think you go
I turn around and you're creeping in
And I let you under my skin
Guess I love living in the sin
Oh, you never told me
True love was gonna hurt
True pain I don't deserve
Truth is that I never learned (Ooo-ohh)

I keep going to the river to pray (Ooh, yeah)
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain (Oh, oh)
And at most, I'm sleeping all these demons away (Oh)
But your ghost, the ghost of you (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
It keeps me awake
I keep going to the river to pray
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
And at most, I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you
It keeps me awake

Give up the ghost, give up the ghost
Give up the ghost, stop the haunting, baby
Give up the ghost, give up the ghost
Give up the ghost, no more haunting, baby
I keep going to the river

I keep going to the river to pray (Ooh, yeah)
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain (Oh, yeah)
And at most, I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you (Your ghost, oh, oh, whoa)
It keeps me awake
I keep going to the river to pray (I keep going, oh, yeah)
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain (Ooh)
And at most, I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you (Ooh, ghost)
It keeps me awake"
393,Here,Alessia Cara,"I guess right now you've got the last laugh

I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin' or I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really, I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So, you can go back, please, enjoy your party
I'll be here, somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana with this boy who's hollerin'
I can hardly hear over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you, so tell my friends that I'll be over here

Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
Oh-oh-oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't to bother me, but honestly, I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people, we can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams, how we plan to take over the planet
So, pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand that I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossipin' about her friends
So, tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwin' up
'Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God, why am I here?

Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
Oh-oh-oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Hours later, congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl talkin' 'bout her haters, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this? I should've never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low
Yo, I'll be over here

Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
Oh-oh-oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
And I can't wait till we can break up out of here"
394,Waves,Mr Probz,"My face above the water
My feet can't touch the ground
Touch the ground, and it feels like
I can see the sands on the horizon
Everytime you are not around

I'm slowly drifting away (drifting away)
Wave after wave, wave after wave
I'm slowly drifting (drifting away)
And it feels like I'm drowning
Pulling against the stream
Pulling against the stream

I wish I could make it easy
Easy to love me, love me
But still I reach, to find a way
I'm stuck here in between
I'm looking for the right words to say

I'm slowly drifting, drifting away
Wave after wave, wave after wave
I'm slowly drifting (drifting away)
And it feels like I'm drowning
Pulling against the stream
Pulling against the stream"

Ah, ah

Tell me if it's true
They told me that you're getting married
You don't know what I'm suffering
I've got to tell you this
Tell me
Your farewell to me was hard
Could it be that it took you to the moon?
And I didn't know how to do it like this

I was looking for you down the streets screaming
This is killing me, oh no
I was looking for you down the streets screaming (Oh)
Like a madman drinking, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh

It's me without you, and you without me
Tell me who can be happy?
I don't like this
I don't like this
It's me without you, and you without me
Tell me who can be happy?
I don't like that
I don't like that

And I can't take no more without you
That's why I come to tell you how I feel
I'm suffering in the loneliness (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
And even though your father didn't approve of this relationship
I still insist on asking for forgiveness
The only thing that matters is in your heart

I was looking for you down the streets screaming
This is killing me, oh no
I was looking for you down the streets screaming
Like a madman drinking, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh

It's me without you, and you without me
Tell me who can be happy?
I don't like this
I don't like this
It's me without you, and you without me
Tell me who can be happy?
I don't like that
I don't like that

I swore to you this eternal love
And now someone else gives you warmth
When in the 'night' you're cold, oh-oh, oh
I know he seems better to you
But I'm in your heart
And for that I ask for forgiveness (I ask for forgiveness)

It's me without you, and you without me
Tell me who can be happy
I don't like this (Oh, no, oh)
I don't like this
It's me without you, and you without me
Tell me who can be happy?
I don't like this, ah-ah-ah
Oh, yeah, woh-oh

They say you don't know what you got till you lose it, but (You without me)
What you want is worth fighting for (And me without you)
(I can't live like this)
And make the attempt

Back to back for the niggas that didn't get the message

Back to back, like I'm Jordan '96, '97
Woah—very important and very pretentious
When I look back, I might be mad that I gave this attention
Yeah, but it's weighin' heavy on my conscience
Yeah, and fuck, you left The Boy no options
I wanna see my niggas go insane
You gon' make me step out of my fuckin' frame
You gon' make me buy bottles for Charlamagne
You gon' make me go out of my fuckin' way
I waited four days, nigga, where y'all at?
I drove here in the Wraith, playin' AR-AB
I'm not sure what it was that really made y'all mad
But I guess this is what I gotta do to make y'all rap
I mean woah, can't fool the city, man, they know what's up
Second floor at Tootsies, gettin' shoulder rubs
This for y'all that think that I don't write enough
They just mad 'cause I got the Midas touch
You love her, then you gotta give the world to her
Is that a world tour or your girl's tour?
I know that you gotta be a thug for her
This ain't what she meant when she told you to open up more
Yeah, trigger fingers turn to Twitter fingers
Yeah, you gettin' bodied by a singin' nigga
I'm not the type of nigga that'll type to niggas
And shout to all my boss bitches wifin' niggas
Make sure you hit him with the prenup
Then tell that man to ease up
I did another one, I did another one
You still ain't did shit about the other one

I got the drink in me, going back to back
Yeah, going back to back
I got the drink in me, going back to back
Yeah, I'm going back to back

Not even when you saying, ""Drizzy, tell 'em again!""
I been puttin' on a show, it was a sell-out event
Oh, you need better seatin'
I didn't wanna do it, gave me every reason
The point I'm tryin' to make is I don't ever need 'em
Seen what you'd do for fame, what would you do for freedom?
Please, check 'em for a wire or a earpiece
Please, please do not let these niggas near me
Please, think before you come for the great one
Please, who's a real nigga and who ain't one?
Please, somebody stop me
I'm talkin' boasy and gwanin wassy
I got the fest in five days and it's my shit
Soon as a nigga hit the stage, they gon'

You think I'm cryin' on my own, well, I ain't

'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'

The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

It's definitely not showing up
I know ""Hennessy"" has two ""S""es for sure, so I'm gonna take out one of the ""N""s"

404,Stressed Out,Twenty One Pilots,"I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told, when I get older, all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure, and I care what people think

My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out (Oh)
Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
We're stressed out

Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's comin' from?
I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and treehouse homes, we all would take the latter

My-my-my name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out (Oh)
Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face
Sayin', ""Wake up, you need to make money,"" yeah
We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face

I was wondering if after all these years, you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healin'
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened?

It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time
So hello from the other side (Other side)
I must've called a thousand times (Thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home

411,7 Years,Lukas Graham,"Once, I was seven years old, my mama told me
""Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely""
Once, I was seven years old

It was a big, big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learnin' quicker
By eleven, smokin' herb and drinkin' burnin' liquor
Never rich, so we were out to make that steady figure

Once, I was eleven years old, my daddy told me
""Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely""
Once, I was eleven years old

I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writin' songs, I started writin' stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told
Before the mornin' sun, when life was lonely
Once, I was twenty years old (Lukas Graham!)

I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me, at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later
Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told
I was writin' 'bout everything I saw before me
Once, I was twenty years old

Soon, we'll be thirty years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still roamin'
Soon, we'll be thirty years old

I'm still learnin' about life, my woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs and I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me, some are still out seekin' glory
And some I had to leave behind, my brother, I'm still sorry

Soon, I'll be sixty years old, my daddy got sixty-one
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit once or twice a month

Soon, I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?
Soon, I'll be sixty years old
Soon, I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?
Soon, I'll be sixty years old

Once, I was seven years old, my mama told me

What else can we do when we're feelin' low?

I'll be your lifeline tonight (I won't let, yeah, yeah)

Come on, come on, save me from my rocking boat
I just wanna stay afloat, I'm all alone (Float, float, float, float)
And I hope, I hope someone's gonna take me home
Somewhere I can rest my soul (Rest my soul)

435,Dangerous Woman,Ariana Grande,"Oh, yeah

Don't need permission
Made my decision to test my limits
'Cause it's my business, God as my witness
Start what I finished
Don't need no hold up
Taking control of this kind of moment
I'm locked and loaded
Completely focused, my mind is open

All that you got
Skin to skin, oh my God
Don't you stop, boy

Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout

Nothing to prove and I'm bulletproof and
Know what I'm doing
The way we're movin'
Like introducing us to a new thing
I wanna savor, save it for later
The taste, the flavor, 'cause I'm a taker, 'cause I'm a giver
It's only nature, I live for danger

All that you got
Skin to skin, oh my God
Don't ya stop, boy (Oh, yeah)

Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you

All girls wanna be like that
Bad girls underneath, like that
You know how I'm feeling inside

436,Jumpman,Drake & Future,"3 ContributorsTranslationsEnglishPortuguêsDrake & Future - Jumpman (Русский перевод) Lyrics
Если Young Metro не доверяет тебе, тогда я тебя пристрелю
Ага, ах, ага
Хэллоуин
Талибан, Талибан
Я тебя пристрелю (Ага)

Джампмен, Джампмен, Джампмен, эти парни что-то задумали
Они провели где-то две или три недели за границей
Эти парни что-то задумали, они не просто блефуют
Тебе не стоит мне звонить, я взрываю танцпол как Usher, ууу
Я нащупал свой ритм, прям как DJ Mustard, ууу
Я попадаю в цель одной левой, как Ginóbili
Лобстер и Céline для всех моих малышек, по которым я скучаю
Куриные палочки и картошка-фри для тех шлюх, которые всё хотят меня задиссить
Джампмен, Джампмен, Джампмен, эти парни что-то задумали
Уф, уф, уф, думаю, мне нужно немного Робитуссина
Слишком много вопросов, ты наверняка думаешь, что я тебе доверяю
Ты в поисках ответов, но я ничего не знаю, ууу
Я вижу, в каком они восторге, они знают, что-то приближается, ууу
Джампмен, Джампмен, Джампмен, эти парни что-то задумали
Джампмен, Джампмен, Джампмен, чего вы, чёрт возьми, ожидали? Ууу
Чикаго, Чикаго, Майкл Джордан мне только что написал, ууу

Джампмен, Джампмен, Джампмен, Джампмен, Джампмен, Джампмен
Я увидел, как их джет взлетел, они что-то задумали
Эти парни не просто блефуют, эти парни не просто блефуют
Джампмен, Джампмен, Джампмен, эти парни что-то задумали
Она пыталась вступить в команду, я попросил её подождать
Куриные крылышки и картошка-фри: мы не ходим на свидания
Nobu, Nobu, Nobu, Nobu, Nobu, Nobu
Я организовал нам частный ужин в ЛА
Торговля наркотой — это лишь хобби, именно так всё и получилось
Деньги льются рекой, мы никогда не спим
Мне, мне пришлось купить ещё один сейф
Мои Bentley Spurs и Phantom, как броски с отклонением Джордана

Ага, Джампмен, Джампмен, я не нуждаюсь в представлении
Джампмен, Джампмен, Metro Boomin на продакшене, вау
Сотни кузенов в Мемфисе, они такие простаки, вау
Сказал ей: “Оставайся на ночь, твою машину припаркуют, иди сюда и потрахайся со мной”
Джампмен, Джампмен, я флексю в прямом эфире на TNT, ууу
Джампмен, Джампмен, они создали мою собственную коллекцию, ууу
Прыгай, когда я говорю, детка, ты можешь быть немного послушной? Ууу
Веду себя, как Mutombo с этими сучками, и продолжаю вас отвергать, ууу

Слышал, они забегали в Magic City в понедельник
Слышал, они взбудоражили весь клуб, там было полно звёзд
Куча девушек сходят с ума, когда твоя цепь усеяна бриллиантами
И они такие типа “Вау”, в моём стакане лин

Дилер, дилер, дилер, дилер, дилер, дилер
Бабки на столе, стволы на полу
Я нащупал свой ритм, прям как DJ Mustard, ууу
Слишком много кодеина и Аддерала
Мы просто подчитываем кучу бабла, вау
Я знаю, верну свою сучку назад, вау
Я подсчитываю все эти бабки, что сейчас на мне, и ты скажешь лишь “Вау”
Chanel N°9, Chanel N°5 — ну, у тебя есть оба аромата

Джампмен, Джампмен, Джампмен, эти парни что-то задумали
Они провели где-то две или три недели за границей
Эти парни что-то задумали, они не просто блефуют
Джампмен, Джампмен, Джампмен, эти парни что-то задумали"
437,"I Hate U, I Love U",Gnash,"Feeling used, but I'm
Still missing you and I can't
See the end of this
Just wanna feel your kiss against my lips
And now all this time is passing by
But I still can't seem to tell you why
It hurts me every time I see you
Realize how much I need you

I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

I miss you when I can't sleep
Or right after coffee or right when I can't eat
I miss you in my front seat
Still got sand in my sweaters
From nights we don't remember
Do you miss me like I miss you?
Fucked around and got attached to you
Friends can break your heart, too
And I'm always tired, but never of you
If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that shit
I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that shit
I type a text, but then I never mind that shit
I got these feelings, but you never mind that shit
Oh oh, keep it on the low
You're still in love with me, but your friends don't know
If you wanted me, you would just say so
And if I were you, I would never let me go

I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

I don't mean no harm, I just miss you on my arm
Wedding bells were just alarms
Caution tape around my heart
You ever wonder what we could have been?
You said you wouldn't and you fucking did
Lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix
Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed
Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing
Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing
But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
When love and trust are gone
I guess this is moving on
Everyone I do right does me wrong
So every lonely night, I sing this song

I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

All alone, I watch you watch her
Like she's the only girl you've ever seen
You don't care, you never did
You don't give a damn about me
Yeah, all alone, I watch you watch her
She is the only thing you've ever seen
How is it you never notice
That you are slowly killing me?

I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her"
438,Here,Alessia Cara,"I guess right now you've got the last laugh

I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin' or I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really, I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So, you can go back, please, enjoy your party
I'll be here, somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana with this boy who's hollerin'
I can hardly hear over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you, so tell my friends that I'll be over here

Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
Oh-oh-oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't to bother me, but honestly, I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people, we can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams, how we plan to take over the planet
So, pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand that I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossipin' about her friends
So, tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwin' up
'Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God, why am I here?

Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
Oh-oh-oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Hours later, congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl talkin' 'bout her haters, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this? I should've never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low
Yo, I'll be over here

Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
Oh-oh-oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
And I can't wait till we can break up out of here"

Wasting tonight on you, I know
I've heard it all, so don't you try and change your mind

441,Like I'm Gonna Lose You,Meghan Trainor,"I found myself dreamin' in silver and gold
Like a scene from a movie that every broken heart knows
We were walkin' on moonlight and you pulled me close
Split second and you disappeared and then I was all alone

I woke up in tears, with you by my side
A breath of relief, and I've realised
No, we're not promised tomorrow

So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna hold you like I'm saying goodbye

So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you (Lose you)
I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you

You could lose everything, the truth is you never know
So I'll kiss you longer, babe (Hey), any chance that I get
I'll make the most of the minutes and love with no regret

Let's take our time to say what we want (Say what we want)
Use what we got before it's all gone (All gone)

443,Let It Go,James Bay,"From walking home and talking loads
To seeing shows in evening clothes with you
From nervous touch and getting drunk
To staying up and waking up with you

Now we're slipping near the edge
Holding something we don't need
All this delusion in our heads
Is gonna bring us to our knees

So, come on, let it go, just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
Everything that's broke, leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
And I'll be me

From throwing clothes across the floor
To teeth and claws and slamming doors at you
If this is all we're living for
Why are we doing it, doing it, doing it anymore?

I used to recognize myself
It's funny how reflections change
When we're becoming something else
I think it's time to walk away

So, come on, let it go, just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
Everything that's broke, leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
And I'll be me

Tryna fit your hand inside of mine
When we know it just don't belong
'Cause no force on earth could make it feel right, no, no
Tryna push this problem up the hill
When it's just too heavy to hold
I think now's the time to let it slide

So, come on, let it go, just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
Everything that's broke, leave it to the breeze
Let the ashes fall, forget about me

Come on, let it go, just let it be

445,Never Forget You,Zara Larsson & MNEK,"2 ContributorsNever Forget You (MNEK VIP) Lyrics
Never forget you
Never forget you
Never forget you
Never forget you
Never forget you
Never forget you
Never forget you
Never forget you

I used to be so happy, but without you here, boy, I feel so low
Boy, I feel so low
I watched you as you left, butit's just so damn hard to let you go
Hard to let you
'Cause once upon a time you were my everything
It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing
It's buriеd deep inside me, but I feel therе's somethin' you should know
Something you should know

I will never forget you
And you will always be by my side
From the day that I met you
I knew that I would love you 'til the day I die
And I will never want much more
And in my heart, I will always be sure
I will never forget you
And you will always be by my side 'til the day I die

Never forget you
Never forget you
Never forget you
Never forget you
Never forget you
Never forget you
Never forget you
Never forget you
Never forget you
Never forget you
Never forget you
Never forget you
Oh, ooh

Funny how we both end up here, but everything seems so right, oh-ah
I wonder what would happen if we went back and put up a fight
'Cause once upon a time you were my everything
It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing
So, what in this world do you think could ever take you off my mind?

I will never forget youo
I, I
Never forget you
Yeah
I will never forget you
I will never forget you

I'm feelin' it, lovin' it, everything that we do
I will never forget you, I will never forget you
And all along, I knew I had somethin' special with you
I will never forget you, I will never forget you (I will never)

Trap jumpin', I'm ring-ring-ringin'

Button start the foreign, oh my God, I'm gorgeous
I just put the key inside my pocket
Park it, might not get to see it, this a new Ferrari
Man in the mirror, how you choose to bother
Someone said they callin', I don't feel like talkin'
Everything I get returned the way I bought it
Phone be interrupting me while I'm recordin'
Phone be making women feel they unimportant
Call my dog, he say it's all the way retarded
Keep the oil 'cause I am not using the Foreman
Kitchen, I just finished up a new performance
Hater, wish you well
I got clientele
I just got it off the scale

I got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load
I got two phones, one for the bitches and one for the dough
Think I need two more

There they go again, one of my lil friends
They don't give a damn how a nigga been
All they wanna know is what I got to give
How much did I spend? What I got to lend?
What I did and what I didn't do for them
Bricks comin' in somewhere on the rim
Section doin' numbers, nowhere by a gym
Droppin' bottles, spend, I'm supplyin' ten
Jumpin' out a Honda, I just got it in
Askin' what I cop, none of your concern
One day you gone learn what you tryna get
Everything on sale, goin' out of biz
Partners up in jail, gotta feed the kids
Juggin' round the city, you know what it is
Bread winner business, put that on the wrist

I got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load

Ring, ring, ringin' man
Find me balling hard
Come from grinding hard
Getting calling cards from your Barbie doll
When she 'round me, she know I'm her bodyguard
Money callin' for me, baby girl, I'm sorry
You just high yella, you not that important
Weight, shape her, I could pin you to the carpet
Smell like tartar, I'ma put you in the water
Conversation cost a lot of chips
She don't really get a lot of this
Engagin' where I'm gazin' at her hips
And ain't nobody makin' no attempts
Amazing clip, hanging, slanging dick
Maybe we can make it takin' trips
Maybe I was thinkin' too impatient
Phone ringing, hold up, what it is?

Like, who gon' try us?
Feeling the world go against us ('Gainst us)
So we put the world on our shoulders

I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games (I'm just a sucker for pain)
I wanna chain you up, I wanna tie you down
Ooh (Oh), I'm just a sucker for pain

I been at it with my homies, it don't matter, you don't know me
I been rollin' with my team, we the illest on the scene
I been riding 'round the city with my squad
I been riding 'round the city with my squad
We just posted, getting crazy, living like this is so amazing
Hold up, take a step back when we roll up, 'cause I know what
We been loyal, we been fam, we the ones you trust in
Won't hesitate to go straight to your head like a concussion
I know I been bussin', no discussion for my family
No hesitation, through my scope I see my enemy
Like what's up? Hold up, we finna re-load up
Yes, I re-load up, I know what up, I know what up

I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games (I'm just a sucker for pain)
I wanna chain you up, I wanna tie you down
Ooh (Oh), I'm just a sucker for pain
Uh, devoted to destruction
A full dosage of detrimental dysfunction
I'm dying slow, but the devil tryna rush me
See, I'm a fool for pain, I'm a dummy
Might cut my head off right after I slit my throat
Tongue kiss a shark, got jealous bitches up in the boat
Eating peanut butter and jelly fishes on toast
And if I get stung, I get stoked, might choke
Like I chewed a chunk of charcoal, naked in the North Pole
That's why my heart cold, full of sorrow, the lost soul
And only Lord knows when I'm coming to the crossroads
So I don't fear shit but tomorrow
And I'm a sucker for pain, it ain't nuttin' but pain
You just fuckin' complain, you ain't tough as you claim
Just stay up in your lane, just don't fuck with Lil Wayne
I'ma jump from my plane or stand in front of a train
'Cause I'm a sucker for pain

Used to doing bad, now we feel like we just now gettin' it (Gettin' it)
Ain't got no other way, so we start it and finish it (Finish it)
No pain (No pain), no gain (No gain)
Never stand down, made our own way (Own way)
Never going slow, we pick up the pace (Pick up the pace)
This is what we wanted from a young age (Young age)
No emotion, that's what business is (Business is)
Lord have mercy on the witnesses (Witnesses)

I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you (Oh)
I'm just a sucker for pain

More pain
Got me beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin'
For more pain
Got me beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin'
For more pain
Got me beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin'
For more pain
Got me beggin'..."

475,Lost Boy,Ruth B,"There was a time when I was alone
Nowhere to go and no place to call home
My only friend was the man in the Moon
And even sometimes he would go away too
Then one night, as I closed my eyes
I saw a shadow flying high
He came to me with the sweetest smile
Told me he wanted to talk for a while

He said, ""Peter Pan, that's what they call me
I promise that you'll never be lonely""
And ever since that day

I am a Lost Boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored, we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook
""Run, run Lost Boy,"" they say to me
Away from all of reality
Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me
And Lost Boys like me are free
Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me
And Lost Boys like me are free

He sprinkled me in pixie dust and told me to believe
Believe in him and believe in me
Together we will fly away in a cloud of green
To your beautiful destiny
As we soared above the town that never loved me
I realized I finally had a family
Soon enough, we reached Neverland
Peacefully, my feet hit the sand

And ever since that day

I am a Lost Boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored, we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook
""Run, run Lost Boy,"" they say to me

But I don't wanna be the puppet that you're playing on a string
This queen don't need a king

But then he wanna take control
And I would rather fly solo

Had seven men to do the chores

You were talkin' deep like it was mad love to you
You wanted my heart, but I just liked your tattoos

Can I have a moment before I go?
'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know

You look like a movie, you sound like a song
My God, this reminds me of when we were young

Let me photograph you in this light in case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
It was just like a movie, it was just like a song

I was so scared to face my fears
Nobody told me that you'd be here
And I swear you'd moved overseas
That's what you said when you left me

You still look like a movie, you still sound like a song
My God, this reminds me of when we were young

Let me photograph you in this light in case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
It was just like a movie, it was just like a song

It's hard to admit that (When we were young)
Everything just takes me back (When we were young)
To when you were there (When we were young)
To when you were there
And a part of me keeps holding on (When we were young)
Just in case it hasn't gone (When we were young)
I guess I still care (When we were young)
Do you still care?

It was just like a movie, it was just like a song

483,Hide Away,Daya,"53 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolDeutschHide Away LyricsIn this bouncy track, Daya bemoans the lack of standards when it comes to her male dating pool, and wishes for a man who actually respects her.
“Hide Away” Daya’s debut single.
Boys seem to like the girls who laugh at anything
The ones who get undressed before the second date
Girls seem to like the boys who don't appreciate
All the money and the time that it takes

To be fly as a mother (Hey)
Got my both eyes out for Mr. Right (Hey)
Guessing I just don't know where to find 'em (Hey)
But I hope they all come out tonight (Hey)

Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?
I'm a good, good girl who needs a little company
Looking high and low, someone let me know
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?

Boys seem to like the girls who like to kiss and tell
Talking them up about the things they do so well
But I'd rather find a boy who is down for the chase
Putting in the time that it takes

To be fly as a mother (Hey)
To supply all of my heart's demands (Hey)
Suit and tie, 'cause undercover (Hey)
He's gonna save my life like Superman (Hey)

Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?
I'm a good, good girl who needs a little company
Looking high and low, someone let me know
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?

Tell me where the good boys go
Tell me where the good boys go
Tell me where the good boys go
Won't somebody tell me, tell me? (Hey)
Tell me where the good boys go
Tell me where the good boys go
Tell me where the good boys go
Tell me where the good boys go (Hey)

Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away?
I'm a good, good girl who needs a little company (Hey)
Looking high and low, someone let me know
Where do the good boys go to hide away, hide away? (Hey)

Te rappelles-tu, il n'y a pas fort longtemps
Nous marchions sur le trottoir
Innocent, te souviens-tu?
Tout ce que nous faisions était prendre soin l'un de
L'autre
Mais la nuit était chaude
Nous étions audacieux et jeunes
Tout autour le vent souffle
Nous nous accrochions seulement pour lâcher prise

Soufflez un baiser, mettez le feu aux armes
Nous avons besoin de quelqu'un sur qui compter
Soufflez un baiser, mettez le feu aux armes
Tout ce dont nous avons besoin c'est quelqu'un sur qui
Compter
Soufflez un baiser, mettez le feu aux armes
Nous avons besoin de quelqu'un sur qui compter
Soufflez un baiser, mettez le feu aux armes
Tout ce dont nous avons besoin c'est quelqu'un sur qui
Compter

Que ferons-nous lorsque nous vieillirons ?
Marcherons-nous encore dans la même voie ?
Seras-tu là à mes côtés ?
Debout et fort alors que les vagues se retournent
Quand les nuits sont longues
Je désir ardemment que tu viennes à la maison
Tout autour le vent souffle
Nous nous tiendrons seulement juste pour lâcher prise

Soufflez un baiser, mettez le feu aux armes
Nous avons besoin de quelqu'un sur qui compter
Soufflez un baiser, mettez le feu aux armes
Tout ce dont nous avons besoin c'est quelqu'un sur qui
Compter
Soufflez un baiser, mettez le feu aux armes
Nous avons besoin de quelqu'un sur qui compter
Soufflez un baiser, mettez le feu aux armes
Tout ce dont nous avons besoin c'est quelqu'un sur qui
Compter
Tout ce dont nous avons besoin c'est quelqu'un sur qui
Compter

Tout ce dont nous avons besoin c'est quelqu'un sur qui

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

Soufflez un baiser, mettez le feu aux armes
Nous avons besoin de quelqu'un sur qui compter

All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standin' right here talkin' to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh

Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place

Everything I went through, you were standin' there by my side

And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond'll never be broken, the love will never get lost
And when brotherhood come first, then the line'll never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone

How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standin' there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home

So thankful for that, it's such a blessin', yeah
Turn every situation into heaven, yeah
Oh, you are
My sunrise on the darkest day
Got me feelin' some kind of way
Make me wanna savor every moment slowly, slowly
You fit me, tailor-made love, how you put it on
Got the only key, know how to turn it on
The way you nibble on my ear, the only words I wanna hear
Baby, take it slow so we can last long

Oh, you, you are the magnet and I'm the metal
I keep getting closer and building up the plan
Just thinking about it raises my heartbeat
Oh, yeah I, I'm already liking you more than usual
All my senses are asking for more
This needs to be taken with no hurry

Slowly
I want to smell your neck slowly
Let me whisper things in your ear
So that you'll remember if you're not with me
Slowly
I want to undress you with my kisses, slowly
I sign the walls of your labyrinth
And make your whole body a manuscript
(Hop on, hop on, hop on!
Hop on, hop on!)

I want to see your hair dance
I want to be your rhythm
And you show my mouth
Your favorite places
(Favorite, favorite, baby)
Let me surpass your danger zones
To make you scream
And you forget your last name

If I ask you for a kiss, come, give it to me
I know that you're thinking about it
I've been trying for a while
Baby, this is giving and giving it
You know that your heart with mine makes you go bang-bang
You know that she is looking for my bang-bang
Come, taste from my mouth to see what it tastes like
I want to, I want to, I want to see how much love you can take in
I am not in a hurry, I want to take the trip
Let's start slow, then wild

Step by step, smooth and gentle
We're sticking together, little by little
When you kiss me with such skill
I see that you're malice with tenderness
Step by step, smooth and gentle
We start sticking, little by little
And such beauty is a puzzle
But to solve it here I have the piece
Listen!

Slowly
I want to smell your neck slowly
Let me whisper things in your ear
So that you remember if you're not with me
Slowly
I want to undress you with my kisses, slowly
I sign the walls of your labyrinth
And make your whole body a manuscript

Hop on, hop on!)

I want to see your hair dance
I want to be your rhythm
And you show my mouth
Your favorite places
(Favorite, favorite, baby)
Let me surpass your danger zones
To make you scream
And you forget your last name

Slowly
This is how we do it down in Puerto Rico
I just wanna hear you screaming, “Oh my god!”
I can move forever when it is with you
Dance!

Step by step, smooth and gentle
We're sticking together, little by little
You show my mouth
Your favorite places
(Favorite, favorite, baby)
Step by step, smooth and gentle
We're sticking together, little by little
Until we provoke screams (Fonsi)
And you forget your last name (D.Y.)

Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down, we playin' Tetris

Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk

Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral

Ich habe alte Bücher gelesen
Die von Legenden und Mythen handelten
Achilles und sein Gold
Herkules und seine Geschenke
Spidermans Kontrolle
Und Batman mit seinen Fäusten
Und natürlich sehe ich mich selbst nicht auf dieser Liste

Sie sagte: Wohin würdest du gehen wollen?
Wie viel willst du riskieren?
Ich suche nicht nach irgendjemandem
Mit übermenschlichen Kräften
Ein bisschen Superheld
Ein bisschen Märchenglück
Einfach etwas, in was ich mich verwandeln kann
Jemanden, den ich küssen kann

Ich will etwas genau wie das
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo

Oh, ich will etwas genau wie das

Oh, ich will etwas genau wie das
Ich will etwas genau wie das

Ich habe alte Bücher gelesen
Die von Legenden und Mythen handelten
Die Testamente, die sie erzählten
Der Mond und seine Verdunklung
Und Superman entrollt
Seinen Anzug auf, bevor er abhebt
Aber ich bin nicht die Art Mensch, die hinein passt

Sie sagte: Wohin würdest du gehen wollen?
Wie viel willst du riskieren?
Ich suche nicht nach irgendjemandem
Mit übermenschlichen Kräften
Ein bisschen Superheld
Ein bisschen Märchenglück
Einfach etwas, in was ich mich verwandeln kann

I drink too much and that's an issue, but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again

I know it breaks your heart

And four years, no calls
Now you're lookin' pretty in a hotel bar
And I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop

So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever gettin' older


We ain't ever gettin' older
We ain't ever gettin' older

You look as good as the day I met you
I forget just why I left you, I was insane
Stay and play that blink-182 song
That we beat to death in Tucson, okay

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no call

507,Body Like a Back Road,Sam Hunt,"Got a girl from the Southside, got braids in her hair
First time I seen her walk by, man I 'bout fell up out my chair
Had to get her number, it took me like six weeks
Now me and her go way back like Cadillac seats

Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' fifteen in a thirty, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

The way she fit in them blue jeans, she don't need no belt
But I can turn them inside out, I don't need no help
Got hips like honey, so thick and so sweet, man
And ain't no curves like hers on them downtown streets

Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' fifteen in a thirty, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

We're out here in the boondocks with the breeze and the birds
Tangled up in the tall grass with my lips on hers
On a highway to heaven, headed south of her smile, mmm
Get there when we get there, every inch is a mile

Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' fifteen in a thirty, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

Third things third, send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh
Your spirit up above, oh-ooh

Falling like ashes to the ground, hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down like

510,Say You Won't Let Go,James Arthur,"I met you in the dark, you lit me up
You made me feel as though I was enough
We danced the night away, we drank too much
I held your hair back when you were throwin' up

Then, you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone-cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, ""I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest""

I knew I loved you then, but you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you, but I never showed
But I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old

Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school, wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, woah
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that every day, you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

I'm so in love with you and I hope you know
Darlin', your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far, my dear, look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old

Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me when I needed you most

I'm gonna love you till my lungs give out
I promise till death we part, like in our vows
So, I wrote this song for you, now everybody knows
That it's just you and me till we're grey and old

Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go
Oh, just say you won't let go"

516,Stay,Zedd & Alessia Cara,"3 ContributorsStay (Zedd & Alessia Cara Cover) Lyrics
Waiting for the time to pass you by
Hope the winds of change will change your mind
I could give a thousand reasons why
And I know you, and you've got to

Make it on your own, but we don't have to grow up
We can stay forever young
Living on my sofa, drinking rum and cola
Underneath the rising sun
I could give a thousand reasons why
But you're going, and you know that

All you have to do is stay a minute
Just take your time
The clock is ticking, so stay
All you have to do is wait a second
Your hands on mine
The clock is ticking, so stay

Won't admit what I already know
I've never been the best at letting go
I don't wanna spend the night alone
Guess I need you, and I need to

Make it on my own, but I don't wanna grow up
We can stay forever young
Living on my sofa, drinking rum and cola
Underneath the rising sun
I could give a million reasons why
But you're going, and you know that

All you have to do is stay a minute
Just take your time
The clock is ticking, so stay
All you have to do is wait a second
Your hands on mine
The clock is ticking, so stay

All you have to do is stay
All you have to do is stay
Just stay

All you have to do is stay a minute
Just take your time
The clock is ticking, so stay
All you have to do is wait a second
Your hands on mine
The clock is ticking, so stay"

I wanna be your baby, baby, baby
Spinnin' and it's wet just like it came from Maytag
White girl wasted on that brown liquor
When I get like this, I can't be around you
I'm too lit to dim down a notch
'Cause I could name some things that I'm gon' do

I sent flowers, but you said you didn't receive 'em
But you said you didn't need them (Mike WiLL Made-It!)

That girl is a real crowd pleaser (Oh, yeah)
Small world, all her friends know of me (They know me)
Young bull livin' like an old geezer (Ah)
Quick-release the cash, watch it fall slowly (Slowly)
Frat girls still tryna get even (Tryna get even)
Haters mad for whatever reason (Yeah, yeah)
Smoke in the air, binge drinking (Oh, oh)
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle (And they lose it)

Getting so gone I'm not blinkin'
What in the world was I thinkin'?
New day, new money to be made
There is nothin' to explain
I'm a fuckin' black Beatle, cream seats in the Regal
Rockin' John Lennon lenses, like to see ‘em spread eagle
Took a bitch to the club and let her party on the table
Screamin', ""Everybody's famous!""
Like clockwork, I blow it all
And get some more
Get you somebody that can do both
Black Beatles got the babes belly rollin'
She think she love me, I think she trollin'

That girl is a real crowd pleaser (Oh, yeah)

Smoke in the air, binge drinkin' (Oh, oh)
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle (And they lose it)

Came in with two girls, look like strippers in their real clothes
A broke ho can only point me to a rich ho
A yellow bitch with green hair, a real weirdo
Black man, yellow Lamb', red light go
They seen that Guwop and them just came in through the side door
There's so much money on the floor we buyin' school clothes
Why you bring the money machine to the club for?
Pint of lean, pound of weed, and a kilo
I Eurostep past a hater like I'm Rondo
I upgrade your baby mama to a condo
Like Chapo servin' llello to the gringos
Black Beatle, club close when I say so

That girl is a real crowd pleaser (Oh, yeah)
Small world, all her friends know of me (They know me)
Young bull livin' like an old geezer (Ah)
Quick-release the cash, watch it fall slowly (Slowly)
Frat girls still tryna get even (Tryna get even)
Haters mad for whatever reason (Yeah, yeah)
Smoke in the air, binge drinkin' (Oh, oh, Uncle Jxmmi)
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle (And they lose it)

She's a good teaser, and we blowin' reefer
Your body like a work of art, baby
Don't fuck with me, I'll break your heart, baby
D&G on me, I got a lot of flavor
15 hundred on my feet, I'm tryna kill these haters
I had haters when I was broke, I'm rich, I still got haters
I had hoes when I was broke, I'm rich, I'm still a player
I wear leather Gucci jackets like it's still the 80s
I've been blowin' OG Kush, I feel a lil' sedated
I can't worry about a broke nigga or a hater
Black Beatle, bitch, me and Paul McCartney related

That girl is a real crowd pleaser (Oh, yeah)
Small world, all her friends know of me (They know me)
Young bull livin' like an old geezer (Ah)

Irgendwo entlang der Linien

Du bist die ganze Nacht draußen gewesen
Und ich hatte genug

Nein, ich will es nicht wissen
Wo du gewesen bist oder wo du hingehen wirst
Aber ich weiß, ich werde nicht Zuhause sein
Und du wirst alleine sein

Wer wird dich
Durch die dunkle Seite des Morgens begleiten?
Wer wird dich hin und her schaukeln
Wenn die Sonne dich nicht schlafen lässt?
Wer steht auf, um dich nach Hause zu fahren
Wenn du betrunken und alleine bist?
Wer wird dich
Durch die dunkle Seite des Morgens begleiten?

Ich hatte einen Traum
Wir waren wieder 17
Sommernächte und Die Libertines
Niemals älter werden
Ich werde mitnehmen:
Die Polaroids und die Erinnerungen
Aber du weißt, ich werde gehen
Das schlechteste hinter uns lassen

Wer wird dich
Durch die dunkle Seite des Morgens begleiten?
Wer wird dich hin und her schaukeln
Wenn die Sonne dich nicht schlafen lässt?
Wer steht auf, um dich nach Hause zu fahren
Wenn du betrunken und alleine bist?
Wer wird dich
Durch die dunkle Seite des Morgens begleiten?

Ich bin's nicht, nein, nein
Ich bin's nicht, nein, nein
Ich bin's nicht, nein, nein
Ich bin's nicht, nein, nein
Wer wird dich durch die dunkle Seite des Morgens begleiten?

Your friend ain't cute, but it's fine though

All my bitches come in pairs like balls in my nutsack
I remember ridin' around the city in a Hatchback
Lookin' for a problem with my young goblins
I'ma send a model home with her neck throbbin'
I done made so much money that it's non-stoppin'
Got my brothers on my back like the last name
I remember tellin' everyone I couldn't be tamed
Woah, six months later, I had snapped and now I'm in the game
Went from fake chains to diamonds in another lane
Went from ""Can you take me here?"" to screenin' out the lane
Went from ""Damn, this nigga lame"" to remember my name
So I remember all the people who ain't fucked with me
They went to college, now all them niggas is history
I upgraded from gold to diamonds in my teeth
Ridin' deep in the van, like we lookin' for a mystery (Raggy?)
So don't fuck with me
No, lately I been livin' like luxury
Boat and Kyle stick together like piano keys
And on my mother's mother
I won't fuck a bitch without a damn rubber

I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind

529,Scars to Your Beautiful,Alessia Cara,"She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor

Oh, she don't see the light that's shinin'
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain
And cut her woes away
'Cause covergirls don't cry
After their face is made
But

There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

She has dreams to be an envy, so she's
Starving, you know, covergirls eat nothin'
She says, ""Beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything, what's a little bit of hunger?
I can go a little while longer,"" she fades away

She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface, oh, oh
So to all the girls that's hurtin', let me be your mirror
Help you see a little bit clearer the light that shines within

There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

No better you than the you that you are
No better you than the you that you are
No better life than the life we're livin'
No better life than the life we're livin'
No better time for your shine, you're a star
No better time for your shine, you're a star
Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful

There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing, the world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine (Who can relate? Woo)
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

I don't wanna be alive, I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die today, I just wanna die
I don't wanna be alive, I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die
And let me tell you why

All this other shit I'm talkin' 'bout, they think they know it
I've been praying for somebody to save me, no one's heroic
And my life don't even matter, I know it, I know it
I know I'm hurting deep down, but can't show it
I never had a place to call my own
I never had a home, ain't nobody callin' my phone
Where you been? Where you at? What's on your mind?
They say every life precious but nobody care about mine

I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind

You don't gotta die today, you don't gotta die
I want you to be alive, I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die, now let me tell you why
It's the very first breath when your head's been drowning underwater
And it's the lightness in the air when you're there chest-to-chest with a lover
It's holding on, though the road's long, seeing light in the darkest things
And when you stare at your reflection, finally knowing who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did

I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?
I'm just tryna shed a little light
It can be hard
It can be so hard
But you gotta live right now
You got everything to give right now

I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine (Who can relate? Woo)
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

I finally wanna be alive, I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die today, I don't wanna die
I finally wanna be alive, I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die

Pain don't hurt the same, I know
The lane I travel feels alone
But I'm moving 'til my legs give out
And I see my tears melt in the snow
But I don't wanna cry, I don't wanna cry anymore
I wanna feel alive, I don't even wanna die anymore
Oh, I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't even wanna die anymore"

539,Castle on the Hill,Ed Sheeran,"When I was six years old, I broke my leg
I was runnin' from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Drivin' at ninety down those country lanes
Singin' to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Runnin' from the law through the backfields and gettin' drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh, how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Drivin' at ninety down those country lanes
Singin' to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely gettin' by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill"

If the rhythm drives you to move your head
We already started it like this
My music does not discriminate against anyone
So we're going to break it down
All of my people are moving
Look at the rhythm they have
I make music that entertains
The world wants us, wants us
And it wants me
All of my people are moving
Look at the rhythm they have
I make music that entertains
My music has them dancing strong
And they dance like that

We are breaking the disco
The party doesn’t stop, it only starts
It's like this, it's like that
My darling, la la la la la
France, Colombia
I like it (Freeze)
J Balvin, Willy William
I like it (Freeze)
The DJ’s don’t lie, they like my people
And that went worldwide (Freeze)
We don’t go down, we never stop
It’s another hit and blam!

And where are my people?
Move your head
And where are my people?
Say yeah, yeah, yeah
One, two, three, leggo
(Ay, say yes)

Corner on the corner, that’s where we go
The world is big, but I have it in my hands
I’m very tough, yes, okay, there we go
And over time we keep going up
We keep breaking it here
This party will never end
Bottles up, yeah
I got them dancing, breaking, and I’m still here
We keep breaking it here
This party will never end
Bottles up, yeah
I got them dancing, breaking, and I’m still here

And where are my people?
Move your head
And where are my people?
Say yeah, yeah, yeah
One, two, three, leggo

550,Thunder,Imagine Dragons,"Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things and
Wanna leave my own life behind
Not a ""Yes, sir,"" not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold, have a seat
In the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder

Thunder, thunder, thunder, thun—
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun—
Thunder, th-th-thunder, thunder

Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning, then the thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning, then the thunder, thunder, thunder

Kids were laughin' in my classes
While I was schemin' for the masses
Who do you think you are?
Dreaming 'bout being a big star
They say, ""You're basic,"" they say, ""You're easy""
You're always riding in the backseat
Now I'm smilin' from the stage while
You were clappin' in the nosebleeds

Thunder, thunder, thunder, thun—

I was born like this, since one like this, immaculate conception
I transform like this, perform like this, was Yeshua new weapon
I don't contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head
This that put-the-kids-to-bed
This that I got, I got, I got, I got—

See, you's a, you's a, you's a—
Bitch, your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA

Backbone don't exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge
See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front
Shit I've been through prolly offend you, this is Paula's oldest son
I know murder, conviction, burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead Redemption, scholars, fathers dead with kids
And I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier’s DNA (I’m a soldier's DNA)
Born inside the beast, my expertise checked out in second grade
When I was nine, on sale motel, we didn’t have nowhere to stay
At twenty-nine, I've done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I’m supposed to, antisocial extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And Nazareth gonna plead his case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet say

I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice, fuck your life
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a be-, fuck your life
Five, four, three, two, one
This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin'
Money and power, the mecca of marriages
Tell me somethin'
You motherfuckers can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy, walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder, these are the breaks
These are the times, level number nine
Look up in the sky, ten is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate

Gas in the bitch like it’s premium
Haul ass on a bitch all in the fast lane
Been a bad bitch way before any cash came
I'm established, hundred carats on my name
Run the atlas, I’m a natural, I'm alright

I'm a savage, I'm a asshole, I’m a king
Shimmy ya, shimmy ya, shimmy ya rah (Yeah)
You can tell your nigga he can meet me outside (Yeah)
You can babysit him when I leave him outside
Ain't no other love like the one I know
I done been down so long lost hope
I done came down so hard I slowed
Honestly forever, all a real nigga want

I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up (Fired, fire)
All I want tonight is just to get high up (Yeah)
All I want is, all I want is

Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
10-4, no switchin' sides
Feel somethin' wrong
You actin' shifty, you don't vibe
With me no more, I need
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty

Tell me who you loyal to
Is it money? Is it fame? Is it weed? Is it drink?
Is it comin' down with the loud pipes in the rain?
Big chillin', only for the power in your name
Tell me who you loyal to
Is it love for the streets when the lights get dark?
Is it unconditional when the 'Rari don't start?
Tell me when your loyalty is comin' from the heart

Tell me who you loyal to
Do it start with your woman or your man? (Mmm)
Do it end with your family and friends? (Mmm)
Are you loyal to yourself in advance?
I said, tell me who you loyal to
Is it anybody that you would lie for?
Anybody you would slide for?
Anybody you would die for?
That's what God for

I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up (Fired, fire)
All I want tonight is just to get high up (Yeah)
All I want is, all I want is

Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty

566,Praying,Kesha,"Well, you almost had me fooled
Told me that I was nothing without you
Oh, but after everything you've done
I can thank you for how strong I have become

’Cause you brought the flames and you put me through hell
I had to learn how to fight for myself
And we both know all the truth I could tell
I'll just say this is I wish you farewell

I hope you're somewhere prayin’, prayin'
I hope your soul is changin', changin'
I hope you find your peace
Falling on your knees, prayin'

I'm proud of who I am
No more monsters, I can breathe again
And you said that I was done
Well, you were wrong and now the best is yet to come
'Cause I can make it on my own, oh
And I don't need you, I found a strength I’ve never known
I’ll bring thunder, I'll bring rain, oh-oh
When I’m finished, they won't even know your name

You brought the flames and you put me through hell
I had to learn how to fight for myself

I'll just say this is I wish you farewell

I hope you're somewhere prayin’, prayin'

Ice on my neck, cost me ten times three
Thirty thousand dollars for a nigga to get flee
I just hit Rodéo and I spent like ten Gs
I just did a show and spent the check on my mama
When I go on vacay I might rent out the Bahamas
And I keep like ten phones, damn, I'm really never home

Fettucini with Alfredo
All I wanted was the fame and every game they made on Sega
I was five or six years old when I had told myself, ""Okay you're special""
But I treat you like my equal never lesser
I was twenty-six years old when we had dropped this one amazing record
Had the world steppin'
That's what I call epic
Couple summers later I got paper
I acquired taste for salmon on a bagel
With the capers on a square plate
At the restaurant with the ""why you got to stare"" face
To know I either ball or I record over the snare and bass
Rapper face, dread headed
Golden diamond teeth wearin'
They just mad 'cause I got that cheese, bitch, I keep dairy
Turnt up in the party, gettin' lit to Yachty
With a Spanish Barbie, word to my mami

In the middle of the party, bitch, get off me (off me)

I was feelin' like myself for the first time in a long time
Until I bumped into some of your friends over there talkin' to mine

Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doin' alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin’
The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’
Rain' was drivin’, thunder, lightnin'
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane

Knew it was gonna be a long night
From the moment when
We locked eyes over whiskey on ice
Started talkin' 'bout us again
If I woulda just laid my drink down
And walked out
I wouldn't be in my truck
Driving us to your house

But you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doin' alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin’
The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’
Rain' was drivin’, thunder, lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane

A Category 5
With your smile
Blew me away
And girl it ain't but midnight
You done killed the lights
Bent my heart back to your bedside

Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin'
The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’
Rain was drivin’, thunder n' lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane"
576,Too Good at Goodbyes,Sam Smith,"You must think that I'm stupid
You must think that I'm a fool
You must think that I'm new to this
But I have seen this all before

I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad, but it's true
I'm way too good at goodbyes (I'm way too good at goodbyes)
I'm way too good at goodbyes (I'm way too good at goodbyes)

I know you're thinkin' I'm heartless
I know you're thinkin' I'm cold
I'm just protectin' my innocence
I'm just protectin' my soul

I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less l love you

I'm way too good at goodbyes (I'm way too good at goodbyes)
I'm way too good at goodbyes (I'm way too good at goodbyes)
No way that you'll see me cry (No way that you'll see me cry)

I'm drownin'
I'm drownin'
I'm drownin'
I'm drownin'

Wrist so icy, wonder why she like me, bitch, I'm drownin'
In water, I just bought a Cuban, dipped it in a fountain
Everywhere that I go, it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch, I'm drownin'
I just bought a Cuban ring and dipped it in a fountain
Chain so heavy I feel like I'm holdin' up a mountain
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch, I'm drownin'

I'm with all my niggas, I don't go nowhere without 'em
If they don't let us in they might throw shots at the bouncer
Actavis medicine, got it straight from out the doctor's
I'm with RJ but I call him Wayne 'cause he's a shotta
Pick up the ladder, put it in the gun, make the .9 stretch
Niggas with attitude, but we come straight out of Highbridge
I'm gon' make her panties wet when she see the way I flex
I'm gon' win a Grammy, move my family out the projects
We went from chillin' in the projects to makin' projects
We was tryna get to the top, and they tried to stop us
I talk for myself, bitch I don't need no fucking voucher
She looked at my wrist and she looked at a hundred thousand

Wrist so icy, wonder why she like me, bitch, I'm drownin'
In water, I just bought a Cuban, dipped it in a fountain
Everywhere that I go, it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch, I'm drownin'
I just bought a Cuban ring and dipped it in a fountain
Chain so heavy I feel like I'm holdin' up a mountain
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch, I'm drownin'

Just bought a brand new chain from Avianne
Nigga with attitude but I ain't from Compton
Lil Kodak, bitch, I'm Polo'd down like Carlton
Sniper Gang, I put a nigga on a carton
I'm the shit I'm fartin', I don't know how to potty
Pull up in a 'Rari, I'm in the Yo like Gotti
A Boogie, I'm goin' Scottie, nigga drop my deposit
I ain't Jamaican, bitch I'm Haitian, but I got them shottas
Harley Davidson every day, I'm ridin' with the chopper
They hatin', I know they don't wanna see a nigga prosper
I ain't doing trims, I'm in the cut like I'm a barber
She call me daddy, but I ain't her motherfucking father

Wrist so icy, wonder why she like me, bitch, I'm drownin'
In water, I just bought a Cuban, dipped it in a fountain
Everywhere that I go, it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch, I'm drownin'

The more that I know you, the more I want to

Somethin' inside me's changed
I was so much younger yesterday, oh

I didn't know that I was starvin' 'til I tasted you
Don't need no butterflies when you give me the whole damn zoo
By the way, right away, you do things to my body
I didn't know that I was starvin' 'til I tasted you
By the way, right away, you do things to my body

You know just how to make my heart beat faster
Emotional earthquake, bring on disaster
You hit me head on, got me weak in my knees

Yeah, somethin' inside me's changed
I was so much younger yesterday, yeah
So much younger yesterday, oh, yeah

I didn't know that I was starvin' 'til I tasted you
Don't need no butterflies when you give me the whole damn zoo

If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

I got so many felonies, I might can't never go to Canada
But Drake said he gon' pull some strings, so let me check my calendar
I just popped me one of them one what-you-call-its and it boosted my stamina
Now I'm fucking her on the banister, guess I just East Atlanta'd her
I'm in an all-red drop tarantula, fuck a Challenger
Damn these hoes ain't got no manners, bruh, where's the manager?
I keep throwing rubber bandies up, ho, pull your panties up
'Cause you fuck like a granny fuck, you're just an amateur
This Patek Philippe gon' make this crooked judge try throw the book at me
I look like half a million worth of heroin when she look at me
But you ain't gotta fuck with me, my nig, but you're stuck with me
But how you called the cops on me, my nig? You grew up with me

I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now, got me talking about my life
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now and I need ya in my life
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now

Yeah, I'm both
Yeah, I had a drink, yeah, I smoked
Yeah, you think I need you but I don't
Just left out Dubai with all my folk
Open water, my location is remote
Shout-out Yachty but this ain't a lil' boat
This some shit I wrote about when I was broke
See, the power of the mind is not a joke
Man, I said that I would do it and I did
Used to get left-overs out the fridge
Nobody was famous where I lived
'Til I got it jumping at the crib
Took a lot to be able to give, I mean

I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now, got me talking about my life
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now and I need ya in my life

We are searchlights, we can see in the dark
We are rockets, pointed up at the stars
We are billions of beautiful hearts
And you sold us down the river too far

What about us?
What about all the times you said you had the answers?
What about us?
What about all the broken happy ever afters?
What about us?
What about all the plans that ended in disaster?
What about love? What about trust?
What about us?

We are problems that want to be solved
We are children that need to be loved
We were willin', we came when you called
But man, you fooled us
Enough is enough, oh

What about us?
What about all the times you said you had the answers?
What about us?
What about all the broken happy ever afters?
Oh, what about us?
What about all the plans that ended in disaster?
Oh, what about love? What about trust?
What about us?

Oh, what about us?
What about all the plans that ended in disaster?
What about love? What about trust?
What about us?

Sticks and stones, they may break these bones
But then, I'll be ready, are you ready?
It's the start of us, waking up, come on
Are you ready? I'll be ready
I don't want control, I want to let go
Are you ready? I'll be ready
'Cause now it's time to let them know
We are ready, what about us?

What about us?
What about all the times you said you had the answers?
So, what about us?
What about all the broken happy ever afters?
Oh, what about us?
What about all the plans that ended in disaster?
Oh, what about love? What about trust?

586,Sign of the Times,Harry Styles,"Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
Welcome to the final show
I hope you're wearing your best clothes
You can't bribe the door on your way to the sky
You look pretty good down here
But you ain't really good

If we never learn we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets, the bullet?
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
Your bullets, a bullet?

Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
We gotta get away from here
We gotta get away from here
Just stop your crying, it'll be alright
They told me that the end is near
We gotta get away from here

Just stop your crying, have the time of your life
Breaking through the atmosphere
Things look pretty good from here
Remember everything will be alright
We can meet again somewhere
Somewhere far away from here

We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets, the bullets?
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets, the bullets?

Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
We gotta get away from here
We gotta get away from here
Stop your crying, baby, it'll be alright
They told me that the end is near
We gotta get away from here

We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
Your bullets, the bullets?
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
Your bullets, your bullets?

We don't talk enough
We should open up
Before it's all too much
Will we ever learn?
We've been here before
It's just what we know

Stop your crying, baby, it's a sign of the times
We gotta get away
We got to get away, we got to get away
We got to get away, we got to get away
We got to, we got to run
We got to, we got to run
We got to, we got to run away"
587,Water Under the Bridge,Adele,"If you're not the one for me
Then how come I can bring you to your knees?
If you're not the one for me
Why do I hate the idea of being free?
And if I'm not the one for you
You've gotta stop holdin' me the way you do
Oh, honey, if I'm not the one for you
Why have we been through what we have been through?

It's so cold out here (Here, here, here)
In your wilderness (Eh, eh, eh)
I want you to be my keeper (Eh, eh, eh)
But not if you are so reckless

If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge

Woah
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge

What are you waiting for?
You never seem to make it through the door
And who are you hiding from?
It ain't no life to live like you're on the run
Have I ever asked for much?
The only thing that I want is your love

If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge

Woah
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge

It's so cold (Here, here, here)
In your wilderness (Eh, eh, eh)
I want you to be my keeper (Eh, eh, eh)
But not if you are so reckless (Ooh)

If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge

Woah

Say that our love ain't water under the bridge

588,Malibu,Miley Cyrus,"I never came to the beach or stood by the ocean
I never sat by the shore under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here and I'm happy that you did
'Cause now I'm as free as birds catchin' the wind
I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand

But here I am, next to you
The sky's more blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you (Baby)

We watched the sun go down as we were walkin'
I'd spend the rest of my life just standing here talkin'
You would explain the current as I just smile
Hoping that you'll stay the same and nothing will change
And it'll be us just for a while, do they even exist?
That's when I make a wish to swim away with the fish
'Cause it's supposed to be this hot all summer long
I never would've believed you if three years ago you told me
I'd be here writing this song

But here I am, next to you
The sky's so blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you (Baby)

Ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah

Next to you
The sky's so blue in Malibu (Baby)
Next to you (Oh, oh)

We are just like the waves that flow back and forth
Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning and you're there to save me
And I wanna thank you with all of my heart
It's a brand new start, a dream come true in Malibu"

On all your wasted cryin'
When you should be with me instead?
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can

I'll stop time for you
The second you say you'd like me to

And any girl like you deserves a gentleman

I'm a mama's boy, I'm a fist fight
Kinda county line, kinda cold beer
Little hat down, little John Deere
I kinda give a damn, I kinda don't care
You see that girl standing right there

She loves a small town boy like me
She's my ride or die baby
She's my cool, she's my crazy
She's my laid back in the front seat
She's my with me to the end girl
My turn it up to ten girl
She could have anybody that she wants
Or be anywhere she wants to be
She loves a small town boy like me

She likes my T-shirt, she likes my old boots
Likes to slow dance to some old school
She'd take a full moon over them city nights
And I ain't scared to get all up in them bright lights
Yeah, I could smooth it out, I could stick it up
I guess that's why she can't get enough

Of a small town boy like me

Oh, darlin', just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me

'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowin' what it was
I will not give you up this time
But, darlin', just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holdin' mine

Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, ""Darlin', you look perfect tonight""

Well, I found a woman stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that, someday, I'll share her home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fightin' against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darlin', just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When I saw you in that dress, lookin' so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darlin', you look perfect tonight

No, no, no
Mm, no, no

Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
We're barefoot on the grass, oh, listenin' to our favourite song

An angel in person and she looks perfect
I don't deserve this, you look perfect tonight"

I like going to the jeweler, I put rocks all in my watch
I like texts from my exes when they want a second chance
I like proving niggas wrong, I do what they say I can't
They call me Cardi Bardi, banging body
Spicy mami, hot tamale
Hotter than a Somali, fur coat, Ferrari
Hop out the stu', jump in the coupe (the coupe)
Big Dipper on top of the roof
Flexing on bitches as hard as I can
Eating halal, driving the Lam'
Told that bitch I'm sorry though
'Bout my coins like Mario (Mario)
Yeah they call me Cardi B, I run this shit like cardio
Oh, damn

Diamond district in the chain (I said I like it like that)
Certified, know I'm gang, gang, gang, gang (I said I like it like—)
Drop the top and blow the brains (I said I like it like that)
Oh he's so handsome, what's his name? (I said I like it)
Oh I need the dollars (I said I like it like that)
Beat it up like piñatas (I said I like it like—)
Tell the driver, close the curtains (I said I like it like that)
Bad bitch make him nervous (I said I like it)
Cardi B

They reload, they reload, but don't pull the trigger (pull the trigger!)
You buy all the Jordan's, fool, they gift them to me
I spend in the club (woo), what you have in the bank (yeh)
This is the new religion, bang, in Latino gang, gang, yeh
I try to diet (yeh), but in the closet I got too much fat (woo!)
I already moved the Gucci to inside my house, yeh (woo!)
Motherfucker, nobody knows you, not even in Plaza (no)
The Devil calls me but Jesus Christ hugs me (amen)
Guerrero like Eddie, long live the race (yeh)
I like Boricuas, I like Cubans 
I like the accent of the Colombians (what's going on?)
I like how she shakes the ass the Dominican (what's up?)
How good they fuck me the Venezuelans (woo!)
We are active, Perico Pin Pin (woo)
Hundred dollar bills in the briefcase (ching)
Let the bass resound, Bobby Valentin, yeh
Love is forbidden here, tell them, Charytín
For their itching I got Claritin
I arrive at the club and the riot begins

Diamond district in the chain (I said I like it like that)
Bad Bunny, baby, be, be, be, be
Certified, know I'm gang, gang, gang, gang (I said I like it like—)
Drop the top and blow the brains (I said I like it like that)
Oh, he's so handsome, what's his name? (I said I like it)
Oh, I need the dollars (I said I like it like that)
Beat it up like piñatas (I said I like it like—)
Tell the driver, close the curtains (I said I like it like that)
Bad bitch make him nervous (I said I like it)

Like Celia Cruz I got the sugar (sugar)
Your girl saw me and fell forward like Jimmy Snuka (ah)
We gonna knock off your wig
And go to hell, motherfucker, we aren't gonna pass you the hookah (hookah, hookah)
My Balenciaga shoes, they receive me in the entrance (woo)
Pa-pa-pa-pa-razzi, like I'm Lady Gaga (woo)
And don't play dumb (hey), in covers of Billboard you have seen me (hey)
I don't leave your head (woo)
Everywhere you go you have heard ""Mi Gente""
I'm not high, I'm like the Testarossa ('rossa)
I'm the one who lives it and enjoys it (enjoys it, enjoys it)
That's the thing, baby that's the thing (thing, thing)
The one who looks suffers and the one who touches enjoys (enjoys, enjoys)

I said I like it like that
I said I like it like that (rrr)
I said I like it like that (woo)
I said I like it like that

Diamond district in the chain (I said I like it like that)
Certified, know I'm gang, gang (I said I like it like—)
Drop the top and blow the brains, wouh (I said I like it like that)
Oh he's so handsome, what's his name? (I said I like it)"
607,The Middle,Zedd & Maren Morris & Grey,"3 ContributorsThe Middle (Zedd, Maren Morris & Grey Cover) Lyrics
One, two, egg!

Take a seat
Right over there, sat on the stairs
Stay or leave
The cabinets are bare, and I'm unaware
Of just how we got into this mess, got so aggressive
I know we meant all good intentions (Two, three!)

So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close?
Why don't you come on over?
I can't just let you go (One, two!)

Oh baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little (Hey!)
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle
Baby, why don't you just meet me in the middlе?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middlе?
In the middle

Take a step
Back for a minute, into the kitchen
Floors are wet
And taps are still runnin', dishes are broken
How did we get into this mess? Got so aggressive
I know we meant all good intentions

So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close?
Why don't you come on over?
I can't just let you go

Oh, baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle
Baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet in the middle, middle?
In the middle, middle

They gotta make some choices, they runnin' out of options
'Cause I've been goin' off and they don't know when it's stoppin'
And when you get to toppin', I see that you've been learnin'
And when I take you shoppin', you spend it like you earned it
And when you popped off on your ex, he deserved it
I thought you were the one from the jump, that confirmed it

Haven't let that thing loose, girl, in so long
You've been inside, know you like to lay low
I've been peepin' what you bringin' to the table
Workin' hard, girl, everything paid for
First-last, phone bill, car note, cable

You got a baby Benz, you got some bad friends
High school pics, you was even bad then
You ain't stressin' off no lover in the past tense

Work at 8 A.M., finish 'round five
Hoes talk down, you don't see 'em outside
Yeah, they don't really be the same offline
You know dark days, you know hard times
Doin' overtime for the last month
Saturday, call the girls, get 'em gassed up
Gotta hit the club, gotta make that ass jump
Gotta hit the club like you hit them mothafuckin' angles
With your phone out, snappin' like you Fabo

No, no, no, no
No-no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead (Uh, uh, uh)
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heartbreak

You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (Can't take back the love that I gave you)
You made my heart break (Were made outta plastic, fake)
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break again (I was tangled up in your drastic ways)
(Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?)

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
Easier said than done, I thought you were—
—instead of my head
You found another— better one
I won't let you forget me"
612,Better Now,Post Malone,"You probably think that you are better now, better now

Everything came second to the Benzo
You're not even speakin' to my friends, no
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were lookin' forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget

615,New Rules,Dua Lipa,"One

Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)

My love
He makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love
He doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself

One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three, don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the mornin'
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
(Nowhere to turn, no way, nowhere to turn, no)
Now I'm standin' back from it, I finally see the pattern
(I never learn, I never learn)

But my love
He doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself
I do, I do, I do

One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three, don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the mornin'
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

617,Never Be the Same,Camila Cabello,"Somethin' must've gone wrong in my brain
Got your chemicals all in my veins
Feelin' all the highs, feelin' all the pain
Let go of the wheel, that's the bullet lane
Now I'm seein' red, not thinkin' straight
Blurrin' all the lines, you intoxicate me

Just like nicotine, heroin, morphine
Suddenly, I'm a fiend and you're all I need
All I need
Yeah, you're all I need

It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never be the same

I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same

Sneakin' in L.A. when the lights are low
Off of one touch, I could overdose

In the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder

Thunder, feel the thunder

While I was schemin' for the masses
Who do you think you are?
Dreaming 'bout being a big star
They say, ""You're basic,"" they say, ""You're easy""
You're always riding in the backseat
Now I'm smilin' from the stage while
You were clappin' in the nosebleeds

My cousins are crazy, my cousins like Boogie
Life is amazin', it is what it should be
Been here for ten, but I feel like a rookie
I tell her, ""Look up,"" 'cause it's snowin' in Tootsie's
Booked for three years, man, you can't even book me
It's me and Lil Baby, this shit goin' crazy
Wheezy produced it and Weezy F. made me
And she held it down, so she got a Mercedes
Young Money Records, the Army, the Navy
They ran me ten thousand, I threw it like Brady
The foreign is yellow like Tracee and K.D.​
I trusted my niggas, they never betrayed me
Met all these niggas, they sweeter than Sadie
When I started out, I just took what they gave me
Did all the favors, they never repaid me
It worked in my favor, 'cause nobody saved me

Brand-new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch, please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like, ""Yes, indeed""

Cartier glasses, I won't even peek at you
Yellow Ferrari like Pikachu
I got 'em waitin' and watchin' what he gon' do
Tryna peep what I do, tryna steal my moves
Twenty-five hundred for a new pair of tennis shoes
The same price, I could make them youngins come and finish you
Lawyer been chargin', he a Jewish like he voodoo
Real dope boy, hundred thousand in Evisu
Presidential tints slide by, we don't see you
I been gettin' money, I ain't worried 'bout what he do
I'm gettin' money like I'm from the eighties
Me and Drake 'bout to drop, man, this shit gon' go crazy
They know I'm the truth, comin' straight from the basement
I'm straight as the street, man, I come from the pavement
A million, all hundreds, it make 'em go crazy
Wham-wham-wham, bitch, I'm the baby

Tailor my clothes, no starch, please

Beni sevdiğini söyledin, delirdiğini söyledim
Arkadaştan fazlası değiliz
Sevgilim değilsin, daha çok abim gibisin
Seni 10 yaşımdan beri tanıyorum, evet

Bunu mahvetme, boktan konuşuyorsun
Yaptığın tek şey beni uzaklaştırmak, hepsi bu!
Beni sevdiğini söylüyorsun, bu beni deli ediyor
İşte yeniden başlıyoruz

Gözlerindeki bu bakışla bana bakarak gitme
Kavga olmadan bir yere gitmiyorsun
Bu gerekçen olamaz, kibar olmaktan vazgeçiyorum
Sana bir kere söyledim, iki, üç, dört, beş, altı bin defa

Açıkça belirtmedim mi?
Yeterince açık söylemedim mi?
Senin için hecelememi ister misin?

626,Bad at Love,Halsey,"Got a boy back home in Michigan
And he tastes like Jack when I'm kissin' him
So I told him that I never really liked his friends
Now he's gone and he's callin' me a bitch again
There's a guy that lives in the Garden State
And he told me that we'd make it 'til we graduate
So I told him that the music would be worth the wait
But he wants me in the kitchen with a dinner plate

I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe that we're meant to be
But jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy get the best of me
Look, I don't mean to frustrate, but I
Always make the same mistakes, yeah
Always make the same mistakes 'cause

I'm bad at love (Ooh-ooh)
But you can't blame me for tryin'
You know I'd be lyin' sayin'
You were the one (Ooh-ooh)
That could finally fix me
Lookin' at my history
I'm bad at love

Got a girl with California eyes
And I thought that she could really be the one this time
But I never got the chance to make her mine
Because she fell in love with little thin white lines
London girl with a attitude
We never told no one, but we look so cute
Both got way better things to do
But I always think about her when I'm ridin' through

I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe that I'm in too deep
And jealousy, jealousy, jealousy, jealousy get the best in me
Look, I don't mean to frustrate, but I
Always make the same mistakes, yeah
Always make the same mistakes 'cause

I'm bad at love (Ooh-ooh)
But you can't blame me for tryin'

I don't wanna make you disappointed, it's annoyin'
I just wanna make you feel like everythin' I ever do
Was never tryna make an issue for you, but I guess the more you
Thought about everything, you were never even wrong
In the first place, right? Yeah, I'ma just ignore you
Walkin' towards you with my head down
Lookin' at the ground, I'm embarrassed for you
Paranoia, what did I do wrong this time?
That's parents for you
Very loyal? Shoulda had my back
But you put a knife in it, my hands are full
What else should I carry for you?

How can we keep going at a rate like this?
We can't, so I guess I'ma have to leave

Go ahead, just drink it off
Both know you're gonna call tomorrow like nothin's wrong
Ain't that what you always do?
I feel like every time I talk to you, you're in an awful mood
What else can I offer you?
There's nothin' left right now, I gave it all to you

Every time I sit on that couch
I feel like you lecture me, eventually, I bet that we
Coulda made this work and prolly woulda figured things out
But, I guess I'm a letdown
But, it's cool, I checked out
Oh, you wanna be friends now?
Okay, let's put my fake face on and pretend now
Sit around and talk about the good times that didn't even happen
I mean, why are you laughin'?
Must have missed that joke, let me see if I can find a reaction
No, but, at least you're happy

Feels like we're on the edge right now

636,Whatever It Takes,Imagine Dragons,"Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling is vulturous
Negative, nepotist
Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this

Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible
Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
I was born to run, I was born for this

Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working hard on something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I'll go down to the grave and die happily
And leave the body and the soul to be a part of thee
I do what it takes

Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes"

Много миллионов долларов, я дурак с хитами (Хэй)
Запрыгиваю в Ламбо и спускаю крышу, показывай сиськи (Скрр)

Хлопаешь, но не будешь стрелять (Хлопаешь)
90 указателей в моих бриллиантах выглядят как хула-обручи (90)
Прыгаю в своих Bentayga и ее место массаж (Хэй)

Купил свои первые Patek, они получили немного дождя (Patek)
Ниггер, как ты меня ненавидишь? (Как? Как?)
Запрыгиваю в Bentley, вышибите из него мозги (Скрр!)
Мы разные, мой нигга
Мой нигга, мы с северной дивизии (Север, NAFW)
Целюсь в твои мозг, да, мы купили тебя как на аукционе, не так ли (Хэй)
Обыграй в общей сложности сто выстрелов, как будто это автомобильная авария (Брр-брр)
Я сделал это дерьмо обязательным, это значит, что я должен был получить его (Хэй)
Мой стрелок умоляет ""пожалуйста"", он готов замочить ниггера
(Пожалуйста, пожалуйста)
Я дал ниггеру бриллиант, я должен был остановить ниггера (Вуу)
Я отдаю твою шлюху как лотерею, ниггер (Здесь, здесь)
Мы дошли до этого, затем мы пошли молиться со священными писаниями пастора (Хэй)

But I can't let go, everybody told me so
Feelin' like I sold my soul

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Tekrar yeni bir savaşa karşı hazırlıklıyım
Bu yolda ilerlemeye devam edeceğim
Her şey hala aynı
Tekrar yeni canlar almaya daima hazırım
Biliyorsunuz bunu sürdürebilirim
Her şey hala aynı (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Söyle bana, beni kendimden kim koruyabilir
Tüm ömrüm boyunca bunu öğrenmek istedim
Söyle bana, beni cehennemden kim koruyabilir
Sen olmadan, ben tamamen yalnızım

Kim benim için dua edecek?
Kim acılarımı benden alacak?
Kim ruhumu koruyacak?
Gördüğün gibi, yalnızım
Eğer senin için ölürsem
Eğer senin için öldürürsem
O zaman senin için kan dökmüş olacağım,hey

Dünyayle savaşıyorum, seninle savaşıyorum, kendimle savaşıyorum
Tanrıyla savaşıyorum, sadece söyle bana yükünün ne kadarından kurtuldun?
Acıyla ve kasırgalarla savaşıyorum, bugün ağladım
Gözyaşlarımla mücadele ediyorum, kapımın eşiğini su basıyor
Cehennem gibi bir hayat, sokaklarda kandan gölcükler
Nişancılar binaların çatısında, devletin yardımları iç açıcı olmuyor
Deprem, dökülen bedenler, yer yarılıyor
Sigaradan ciğerleri zayıflamış fakir bir koşucu ve Scarface
Kimin bir kahramana ihtiyacı var? (Kahraman)
Senin bir kahramana ihtiyacın var, aynaya bak, haydi kahramanına git
Ground Zero'da ön saflarda bekleyen de kim? (Kahraman)
Zor zamanlarda iğne vursan bile, kalbimin ritmi asla şaşmaz
Kitleler imha ediliyor ve bozuluyor
Ruhlar adama acı çektiriyor
Sağır kulaklarını tekrar tıkıyorsun, mahşer günü geliyor
Bunların hepsi bir kehanet ve eğer büyük bir iyilik için kurban edileceksem
Bu derhal yerine getirilmeli

Kim benim için dua edecek?
Kim acılarımı benden alacak?
Kim ruhumu koruyacak?
Gördüğün gibi, yalnızım
Eğer senin için ölürsem
Eğer senin için öldürürsem
O zaman senin için kan dökmüş olacağım,hey

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey

Kim benim için dua edecek?
Kim acılarımı benden alacak?
Kim ruhumu koruyacak?
Gördüğün gibi, yalnızım
Eğer senin için ölürsem
Eğer senin için öldürürsem
O zaman senin için kan dökmüş olacağım,hey

İnancımın yok olması durumunda, kendi yasalarıma göre yaşayacağım
Kendi yasalarıma göre yaşayacağım, kendi yasalarıma göre yaşayacağım
İnancımın yok olması durumunda, kendi yasalarıma göre yaşayacağım
Kendi yasalarıma göre yaşayacağım, kendi yasalarıma göre yaşayacağım"

Thought that I could chase you with the cold evenin'
Let a couple years water down how I’m feelin' about you (Feelin' about you)
And every time we talk
Every single word builds up to this moment
And I gotta convince myself I don’t want it even though I do (Even though I do)

You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true

I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lyin' close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know I’d go back to you

I know I’d go back to you, oh
I know I'd go back to you

We never got it right
Playin’ and replayin' old conversations
Overthinkin' every word and I hate it
'Cause it’s not me ('Cause it's not me, 'cause it's not me)
And what's the point in hidin'?
Everybody knows, we got unfinished business
And I'll regret it if I didn't say
This isn't what it could be (Isn't what it could be)

You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true (Oh, oh)

I know I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you

You can break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true
Won't lie, I'd go back to you
You know, my thoughts are runnin' loose
It's just a thing you make me do
And I could fight, but what's the use?
I know I'd go back to you

I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to (When I'm not supposed to)

Different colored chains, think my jeweler really sellin' fruits

Now I got her open, it's just the Goose

644,Him & I,G-Eazy & Halsey,"1 ContributorHim & I (G-Eazy & Halsey Remix) Lyrics
Cross my heart, hope to die
To my lover, I'd never lie
He said ""be true, "" I swear I'll try
In the end, it's him and I
He's out his head, I'm out my mind
We got that love, the crazy kind
I am his, and he is mine
In the end, it's him and I, him and I

Heart's beating fast when I'm next to the girl of my dreams
I start to rap along everytime that she sings
She got the voice of an angel, she's my everything
2021 Bonnie and Clyde, husband and wife with no wedding ring
Got that kind of love, everybody try to break up
She looks so pretty even without her make up
She try to calm me down everytime I'm getting pissed off
Every chance she'd get, she would try to kiss my lips off
Crazy but I love her, I could never run from her
She's cool like the winter but she hotter than the summer
I might give her another ring as I'm dialing out her number
But it really doesn't matter, as long as we love each other
You know?

Cross my heart, hope to die
To my lover, I'd never lie (I love you, mi amor)
He said ""be true, "" I swear I'll try
In the end, it's him and I
He's out his head, I'm out my mind
We got that love, the crazy kind
I am his, and he is mine
In the end, it's him and I

Him and I
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
In the end, it's him and I
Him and I
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
In the end, it's him and I

 Cross my heart, hope to die
To you, I've never lied
For you, I'd take a life
It's him and I, and I swear (ayy)
 'Til the end I'ma ride wit' you
Mob and get money, get high wit' you, yeah (ayy)
 Cross my heart, hope to die
This is our ride or die
You can confide in me
There is no hiding, I swear
 Stay solid, never lie to you
Swear, most likely I'ma die wit' you, yeah

Cross my heart, hope to die
To my lover, I'd never lie
He said ""be true, "" I swear I'll try
In the end, it's him and I
He's out his head, I'm out my mind
We got that love, the crazy kind
I am his, and he is mine
In the end, it's him and I

Him and I
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
In the end, it's him and I
Him and I
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
In the end, it's him and I"
645,In My Blood,Shawn Mendes,"Help me, it's like the walls are cavin' in
Sometimes, I feel like givin' up
But I just can't

It isn't in my blood

Layin' on the bathroom floor, feelin' nothin'
I'm overwhelmed and insecure, give me somethin'
I could take to ease my mind slowly
Just have a drink and you'll feel better
Just take her home and you'll feel better
Keep tellin' me that it gets better
Does it ever?

Help me
It's like the walls are cavin' in
Sometimes, I feel like givin' up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me
I'm crawlin' in my skin
Sometimes, I feel like givin' up
But I just can't

It isn't in my blood
It isn't in my blood

I'm lookin' through my phone again, feelin' anxious
Afraid to be alone again, I hate this
I'm tryin' to find a way to chill, can't breathe, oh

Is there somebody who could help me?
It's like the walls are cavin' in
Sometimes, I feel like givin' up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me
I'm crawlin' in my skin
Sometimes, I feel like givin' up
But I just can't

It isn't in my blood
It isn't in my blood (Ayy)

I need somebody now
I need somebody now
Someone to help me out
I need somebody now

Help me, it's like the walls are cavin' in
Sometimes, I feel like givin' up
But I just can't

It isn't in my blood (Ooh-ooh)
It isn't in my blood, ohh (Ooh, ooh)

L'amour, parlons d'amour
Est-ce tout ce que tu espérais ?
Ou ce sentiment te hante-t-il ? (Hante)
Je sais que le sentiment te hante (Hante)

Cette nuit pourrait être celle où mes rêves me révéleront que
Toutes les étoiles sont plus proches
Toutes les étoiles sont plus proches
Toutes les étoiles sont plus proches
Cette nuit pourrait être celle où mes rêves me révéleront que
Toutes les étoiles sont plus proches
Toutes les étoiles sont plus proches
Toutes les étoiles sont plus proches

Dis-moi ce que tu vas me faire
La confrontation n'a rien de nouveau pour moi
Tu peux ramener une balle, ramener une épée, ramener une morgue
Mais tu ne peux pas m'apporter la vérité
Va te faire foutre, toi et toutes tes attentes
Je ne veux même pas de tes félicitations
Je reconnais ta fausse confiance
Et tes promesses calculées dans toutes nos conversations
Je hais les gens qui pensent avoir tous les droits
Tu me regardes de travers car je ne t'ai pas invité
Oh, t'es important ?
Tu es la morale de l'histoire ? Tu l'approuves ?
Fils de pute, je ne t'aime même pas
Corrompre le cœur d'un homme avec un cadeau
C'est comme ça que tu découvres à qui tu as à faire
Un petit pourcentage avec lequel je construis
Je veux les mérites que je perde ou que je gagne
Sur la tête de ma mère, c'est la vraie merde

L'amour, parlons d'amour
Est-ce tout ce que tu espérais ?
Ou ce sentiment te hante-t-il ? (Hante)
Je sais que le sentiment te hante (Hante)

Cette nuit pourrait être celle où mes rêves me révéleront que
Toutes les étoiles sont plus proches
Toutes les étoiles sont plus proches
Toutes les étoiles sont plus proches
Cette nuit pourrait être celle où mes rêves me révéleront que
Toutes les étoiles sont plus proches
Toutes les étoiles sont plus proches
Toutes les étoiles sont plus proches

La peau couverte d'ego
Je commence à parler, je m'implique, comme un rebond
Pas de contrôle, pas d'interrupteur
Et la façon dont tu me descends
Ça m'allume, éloigne-le de moi
Maintenant que tu me veux du mal, reste loin de moi
Et c'est tout faux, éloigne-toi de moi, ouais
Je ne fais que pleurer sans raison
Je ne fais que prier sans raison
Je ne fais que remercier pour la vie, pour les jours
Pour les heures et une autre vie à vivre
J'ai tout fait car ça fait du bien
Tu laisserais tout ça si tu te sentais mal
Mieux vaut vivre ta vie, nous étions à court de temps

L'amour, parlons d'amour
Est-ce tout ce que tu espérais ?
Ou ce sentiment te hante-t-il ? (Hante)
Je sais que le sentiment te hante (Hante)

Cette nuit pourrait être celle où mes rêves me révéleront que

648,Too Good at Goodbyes,Sam Smith,"You must think that I'm stupid
You must think that I'm a fool
You must think that I'm new to this
But I have seen this all before

I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad, but it's true
I'm way too good at goodbyes (I'm way too good at goodbyes)
I'm way too good at goodbyes (I'm way too good at goodbyes)

I know you're thinkin' I'm heartless
I know you're thinkin' I'm cold
I'm just protectin' my innocence
I'm just protectin' my soul

I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less l love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad, but it's true
I'm way too good at goodbyes (I'm way too good at goodbyes)
I'm way too good at goodbyes (I'm way too good at goodbyes)

Come kiss me one more time
I couldn't dream this up
Even if I tried
You and me in this moment
Feels like magic, don't it?
I'm right where I wanna be

Everybody's talkin' about heaven like they just can't wait to go
Sayin' how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful
Lyin' next to you, in this bed with you, I ain't convinced
'Cause, I don't know how, I don't know how Heaven, Heaven
Could be better than this

I swear you're an angel
Sent to this world
What did I do right to deserve you, girl?
I could stay here forever
I'd be fine if we never
Had to even leave this room

Everybody's talkin' 'bout heaven like they just can't wait to go
Sayin' how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful

Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves (Ayy, ayy)
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves

Now she say she gon' do what to who? Let's find out and see
Cardi B, you know where I'm at, you know where I be
You in the club just to party, I'm there, I get paid a fee
I be in and out them banks so much, I know they're tired of me
Honestly, don't give a fuck 'bout who ain't fond of me
Dropped two mixtapes in six months
What bitch working as hard as me?
I don't bother with these hoes, don't let these hoes bother me
They see pictures, they say, ""Goals,"" bitch, I'm who they tryna be
Look, I might just chill in some BAPE
I might just chill with your boo, I might just feel on your babe
My pussy feel like a lake
He wanna swim with his face, I'm like, ""Okay""
I'll let him get what he want, he buy me Yves Saint Laurent
And the new whip, when I go fast as a horse
I got the trunk in the front (Vroom, vroom)
I'm the hottest in the street, know you prolly heard of me
Got a bag and fixed my teeth, hope you hoes know it ain't cheap
And I pay my mama bills, I ain't got no time to chill
Think these hoes be mad at me, their baby father run a bill

Said, ""Lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to""
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money moves
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves

If you a pussy, you get popped, you a goofy, you a opp
Don't you come around my way, you can't hang around my block
And I just checked my accounts, turns out, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich
I put my hand above my hip, I bet you dip, he dip, she dip
I say I get the money and go, this shit is hot like a stove
My pussy glitter is gold, tell that lil' bitch play her role
I just arrove in a Rolls, I just came up in a Wraith
I need to fill up the tank, no, I need to fill up the safe
I need to let all these hoes know that none of their niggas is safe
I go to dinner and steak, only the real can relate
I used to live in the P's, now it's a crib with a gate
Rollie got charms, look like Frosted Flakes
Had to let these bitches know, just in case these hoes forgot
I just run and check the mail, another check from Mona Scott

Said, ""Lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to""
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you

I wanna get married, like the Currys, Steph and Ayesha shit
But we more like Belly, Tommy and Keisha shit
Gave you TLC, you wanna creep and shit
Poured out my whole heart to a piece of shit
Man, I thought you woulda learned your lesson
'Bout likin' pictures, not returnin' texts
I guess it's fine, man, I get the message
You still stutter after certain questions
You keep in contact with certain exes
Do you, though? Trust me, nigga, it's cool, though
Said that you was workin', but you out here chasin' culo
And putas, chillin' poolside, livin' two lives
I coulda did what you did to me to you a few times
But if I did decide to slide, find a nigga
Fuck him, suck his dick, you would've been pissed
But that's not my M.O., I'm not that type of bitch
And karma for you is gon' be who you end up with
You make me sick, nigga

The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin' for

Guess you actin' out now, you got an audience
Tell me where your mind is, drop a pin, what's the coordinates?
You might have a fortune, but you lose me, you still gon' be misfortunate, nigga
Tell me, this lust got you this fucked up in the head
You want some random bitch up in your bed?
She don't even know your middle name, watch her 'cause she might steal your chain
You don't want someone who loves you instead? I guess not though
It's blatant disrespect, you nothin' like the nigga I met
Talk to me crazy and you quick to forget
You even got me trippin', you got me lookin' in the mirror different
Thinkin' I'm flawed because you inconsistent
Between a rock and a hard place, the mud and the dirt
It's gon' hurt me to hate you, but lovin' you's worse
It all stopped so abrupt, you started switchin' it up
Teach me to be like you so I can not give a fuck
Free to mess with someone else, I wish these feelings could melt
'Cause you don't care about a thing except your mothafuckin' self
You make me sick, nigga

The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin' for

Ayın karanlık yüzünü gördüm
Aşkın her ilginçliğine baktım
Öfkeyi daha da kolaylaştırıyorum
Hepsi senin için, evet, hepsi senin için
Vahşi ormanın içinde koşuyordum
Kurtlarla birlikte koşuyordum
Senin için, senin için,senin için

Parmak uçların tenimi çiziyor
Bu yerde hiç bulunmadım
Körlük, bir ben takip ediyorum
Bu duvarları yık ve içeri gel

Un beso es todo lo que hace falta
Para enamorarte de mí

Parece que soy todo lo que tú necesitas

Deja que tome la noche, amo con mucha facilidad
Y sé que seguirás queriendo verme
El domingo por la mañana, con la música a tope
Déjame amarte mientras la luna siga ahí fuera

Algo en ti-i-i iluminó el paraíso que hay en mí-i-i
El sentimiento no me dejará dormir
Porque estoy perdida en la forma en que te mueves
La forma en que me haces sentir

Un beso es todo lo que hace falta
Para enamorarte de mí

Solo quiero sentir tu piel sobre la mía
Sentir cómo tus ojos exploran
Pasión en el mensaje cuando sonríes

Porque estoy perdida en la forma en que te mueves

Uh
É, é

Quando eu era jovem, eu me apaixonei
Nós costumávamos dar as mãos, cara, isso é o suficiente (É)
Aí a gente cresceu, começamos a nos tocar
Costumávamos nos beijar debaixo da luz no fundo do ônibus (É)
Eu sei que o seu papai não gostava muito de mim
E ele não acreditava em mim quando eu disse que você era a garota certa
Oh, todo dia, ela achava um jeito de fugir pela janela tarde da noite

Ela costumava me encontrar no lado leste
Na cidade onde o sol não se põe
E todo dia, você sabe que a gente dá uma volta
Pelas ruelas em um Corvette azul
Meu bem, você sabe que eu só quero sair hoje à noite
Nós podemos ir para qualquer lugar que quisermos
Dirigir até a costa, pular no mar
Só pegue na minha mão e venha comigo, é

Nós podemos fazer qualquer coisa se nós focarmos nela
Pegue sua vida antiga, aí coloque uma linha nela
Meu amor é seu se você estiver disposta a tê-lo
Me dê o seu coração porque eu não vou quebrá-lo
Então venha, começando hoje
Começar uma vida nova em um lugar diferente
Nós sabemos que o amor é como todas essas ideias vieram para mim
Então meu bem, fuja comigo

Dezessete, e nós temos um sonho de ter uma família
Uma casa, e tudo entre isso
E aí, oh, de repente, nós fizemos vinte e três
E agora nós estamos pressionados para levar a nossa vida mais a sério
Nós temos nossos empregos ruins e temos contas para pagar
Nossos antigos amigos e agora nossos inimigos
E agora eu, eu estou relembrando quando eu era jovem
Na época em que eu estava me apaixonando

Ele costumava me encontrar no lado leste
Na cidade onde o sol não se põe
E todo dia, você sabe que a gente dá uma volta
Pelas ruelas em um Corvette azul
Meu bem, você sabe que eu só quero sair hoje à noite
Nós podemos ir para qualquer lugar que quisermos
Dirigir até a costa, pular no mar
Só pegue na minha mão e venha comigo, cantando

Nós podemos fazer qualquer coisa se nós focarmos nela
Pegue sua vida antiga, aí coloque uma linha nela
Meu amor é seu se você estiver disposta a tê-lo
Me dê o seu coração porque eu não vou quebrá-lo
Então venha, começando hoje
Começar uma vida nova em um lugar diferente
Nós sabemos que o amor é como todas essas ideias vieram para mim
Então meu bem, fuja comigo

Fugir agora, fugir agora

В последнее время я, я думал
Хочу, чтобы ты была счастливее
Хочу, чтобы ты была счастливее

Когда наступает утро
Когда мы видим, чем мы стали
В холодном свете дня, мы — пламя на ветру
Не то пламя, каким мы начали
Каждую фразу, каждое слово мы не можем взять назад
Потому что со всем тем, что произошло
Я думаю, что мы оба знаем как эта история заканчивается

Потом лишь на минуту
Я хочу изменить свои мысли
Ведь мне они не кажутся верными
Хочу поднять твой дух
Хочу видеть твою улыбку, но
Знаю, что должен буду уйти

Знаю, что должен буду уйти
В последнее время, я, я думал
Хочу, чтобы ты была счастливее
Хочу, чтобы ты была счастливее

Когда наступает вечер
И я оставлен там наедине со своими мыслями
И понимание того, что ты с кем-то еще
Ну, он съедает меня изнутри
Но мы продолжаем идти по своему пути
Сделаем вид, что всё в порядке
И если сейчас мы спрыгнем вместе
Хотя бы сможем уплыть
От той аварии, коей стали причиной

После лишь на минуту
Я хочу изменить свои мысли
Ведь мне они не кажутся верными
Хочу поднять твой дух
Хочу видеть твою улыбку, но
Знаю, что должен буду уйти

Знаю, что должен буду уйти
В последнее время, я, я думал
Хочу, чтобы ты была счастливее
Хочу, чтобы ты была счастливее

Я уйду, уйду, уйду

В последнее время я, я думал
Хочу, чтобы ты была счастлива
Хочу, чтобы ты была счастлива
И даже если мне это не нравится
Я думаю, ты станешь счастливее
Хочу, чтобы ты была счастлива

Потом лишь на минуту
Я хочу изменить свои мысли
Ведь мне они не кажутся верными
Хочу поднять твой дух
Хочу видеть твою улыбку, но
Знаю, что должен буду уйти

Знаю, что должен буду уйти
В последнее время, я, я думал

It's paradise as long as I'm with you

It's like one, two, three
Just as easy as can be
Just the way you look at me, you make me smile
Ain't no need to complicate it
We both know that's overrated
We've been there, it's safe to say it ain't our style
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be

We used to live on Instagram
Worry 'bout who all gives a damn
'Bout where we've been and where we ended up
Then I met you and you met me
And all the rest is history
An epiphany that all we need is us

It's like one, two, three
Just as easy as can be
Just the way you look at me, you make me smile
Ain't no need to complicate it
We both know that's overrated
We've been there, it's safe to say it ain't our style
We're just simple like a six string
The way this world was meant to be
Like laughin', love, make a lot out of a little
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be
It's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E
Simple as can be

Ain't no need to complicate it
We both know that's overrated
We've been there, it's safe to say it ain't our style, yeah

It's like one, two, three
Just as easy as can be
Just the way you look at me, you make me smile
Ain't no need to complicate it
We both know that's overrated
We've been there, it's safe to say it ain't our style
We're just simple like a six string

I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine (Who can relate? Woo)
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

I don't wanna be alive, I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die today, I just wanna die
I don't wanna be alive, I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die
And let me tell you why

All this other shit I'm talkin' 'bout, they think they know it
I've been praying for somebody to save me, no one's heroic
And my life don't even matter, I know it, I know it
I know I'm hurting deep down, but can't show it
I never had a place to call my own
I never had a home, ain't nobody callin' my phone
Where you been? Where you at? What's on your mind?
They say every life precious but nobody care about mine

I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine (Who can relate? Woo)
I've been on the low, I been taking my time

I want you to be alive, I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die today, you don't gotta die
I want you to be alive, I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die, now let me tell you why
It's the very first breath when your head's been drowning underwater
And it's the lightness in the air when you're there chest-to-chest with a lover
It's holding on, though the road's long, seeing light in the darkest things
And when you stare at your reflection, finally knowing who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did

I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?
I'm just tryna shed a little light
It can be hard
It can be so hard
But you gotta live right now
You got everything to give right now

I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine (Who can relate? Woo)
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

I finally wanna be alive, I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die today, I don't wanna die
I finally wanna be alive, I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die

Pain don't hurt the same, I know
The lane I travel feels alone
But I'm moving 'til my legs give out
And I see my tears melt in the snow
But I don't wanna cry, I don't wanna cry anymore
I wanna feel alive, I don't even wanna die anymore
Oh, I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't even wanna die anymore"

Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna get me for my soul
Thankful for the women that I know
Can't go fifty-fifty with no ho
Every month
I'm supposed to pay her bills and get her what she want
I still got like seven years of doin' what I want
My dad still got child support from 1991 (One, one, one)

686,Get Along,Kenny Chesney,"15 ContributorsGet Along Lyrics
Met a man wearin' a T-shirt, said ""Virginia is for lovers""
Had a Bible in his left hand and a bottle in the other
He said ""All you're really given is the sunshine and your name""
We both started laughin' when the sky started to rain

Get along, on down the road
We've got a long long way to go
Scared to live, scared to die
We ain't perfect but we try
Get along while we can
Always give love the upper hand
Paint a wall, learn to dance
Call your mom, buy a boat
Drink a beer, sing a song
Make a friend, can't we all get along?

Saw a model on a billboard, 1-800 get to know me
Wondered was she Photoshopped, or were her eyes really that lonely?
Did she leave her hometown thinkin' she'd end up in L.A.?
Did she break down in the desert and get stuck beside the highway?

Get along, on down the road
We've got a long long way to go
Scared to live, scared to die
We ain't perfect but we try
Get along while we can
Always give love the upper hand
Paint a wall, learn to dance
Call your mom, buy a boat
Drink a beer, sing a song
Make a friend, can't we all get along?

We find out when you die the keys to Heaven can't be bought
We still don't know what love is but we sure know what it's not
Sometimes you got to

Get along, on down the road
We've got a long long way to go
Scared to live, scared to die
We ain't perfect but we try
Get along while we can
Always give love the upper hand
Paint a wall, learn to dance
Call your mom, buy a boat
Drink a beer, sing a song
Make a friend, can't we all get along?"

(E-E-E-E-Evo Jedis)

Cuando yo la vi
Dije, ""Si esa mujer fuera para mí""
Perdóname, te lo tenía que decir

'Tás dura, dura
Dura, dura, dura
Que estás dura, mano arriba porque tú te ves bien
'Tás dura, mamacita, te fuiste de nivel
Dura, mira como brilla tu piel
'Tás dura, dímelo, dímelo, ¿cómo es que e'?
'Tás dura, yo te doy un veinte de diez
'Tás dura, dura, dura

Tú eres la máquina, la máquina de baile
Si no tiene' a nadie vente pa' mi' brazos, caile
Ese perfume se siente en el aire
Algo como Argentina, tú me traes los Buenos Aires
'Tá poderosa, media escandalosa
Habrán muchas mujeres pero tú eres otra cosa
Si fuera un delito eso de que estás hermosa
Te arresto en mi cama y te pongo las esposas
Tienes el toque, toque, toque
Miren el material, edición especial
Tienes el toque, toque, toque
Perdóname, te lo tenía que decir

'Tás dura, dura
Dura, dura, dura
Que estás dura, mano arriba porque tú te ves bien
'Tás dura, mamacita, te fuiste de nivel
Dura, mira como brilla tu piel
'Tás dura, dímelo, dímelo, ¿cómo es que e'?
'Tás dura, yo te doy un veinte de diez
'Tás dura, dura, dura

Me gusta como mueve ese ram-pam-pam
Mi mente maquineando en un plan-plan-plan
Si me deja, en esa curva le doy pam-pam
Cuál es tu receta no sé, 'tás pa' comerte bien
Me gusta como mueve ese ram-pam-pam
Mi mente maquineando en un plan-plan-plan
Si me deja, en esa curva le doy pam-pam
Tu belleza retumba, las otras pa' la tumba

Uno, dos y tres, vamo' a darle, la envidia que se calle
Saludos a to'as las nenas que paralizan la calle
¿Cómo tú te llamas? ¿de dónde tú eres?
Dame el número pa' entrar contigo en detalles
Y tienes el toque, toque, toque
Pareces una estrella formando el alboroto
Tienes el toque, toque, toque
Se cae el internet cuando subes una foto

Cuando yo la vi (Dímelo, baby girl)
Dije: ""Si esa mujer fuera para mí"" (Pa' mí esa baby)
Perdóname, te lo tenía que decir

Mercy
Why you gotta show up lookin' so good just to hurt me?
Why you wanna stop this whole damn world from turning?
Mercy
Why you hanging on so tight if this ain't working?
Why you wanna stop this flame if it's still burning?
'Cause it's still burning

So if you're gonna break my heart, just break it
And if you're gonna take your shot, then take it
Take it
If you made up your mind, then make it
But make this fast
If you ever loved me
Have mercy

If you go out tonight and get drunk and lonely
Wind up home alone
Please don't call me
And say you miss me, no

If you're gonna break my heart, just break it
And if you're gonna take your shot, then take it
Take it
If you made up your mind, then make it
But make this fast
If you ever loved me
Have mercy

Whoa
Oh, have mercy

If you're gonna break my heart, just break it
And if you're gonna take your shot, take it
Take it
Oh, if you're gonna break my heart, just break it
And if you're gonna take your shot, then take it
Take it
If you made up your mind, then make it
Make this fast
If you ever loved me
Mm, if you ever loved me
Have mercy

Oh, have mercy
Oh, have mercy

695,One Number Away,Luke Combs,"Are you sitting at home, all alone, trying to fall asleep?
Are you staring a hole through your phone, praying that it rings?
Are you watching a movie that you've seen a thousand times?
Or maybe playing some Mayer, getting lost in your favorite lines

Well, if you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes
To drown out the noise
But I just wanna hear your voice

I’m one number away
From calling to you
I said I was through
But I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess
Girl, I confess
I lied when I said
""I'm leaving and not coming back""
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go, I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I wanna say
But I'm still one number away

Are you stuck at a red light with a Marlboro Light on your lips?
Does the smoke in your mirror get clearer without my kiss?
Are you changing the station replacing our favorite songs?
Well maybe it's a mistake, hit the brakes on the moving on

Well, if you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes
To outrun the storm
But I'm almost out that door

And I'm one number away
From calling to you
I said I was through
But I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess
Girl, I confess
I lied when I said
""I'm leaving and not coming back""
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go, I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I wanna say
But I'm still one number away

Will you pick up when I call?
Or just forget we loved at all
We don't have to talk
I just wanna hear your voice

And I'm one number away
From calling you
I said I was through
But I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess

I lied when I said

В последнее время я, я думал
Хочу, чтобы ты была счастливее
Хочу, чтобы ты была счастливее

Когда наступает утро
Когда мы видим, чем мы стали
В холодном свете дня, мы — пламя на ветру
Не то пламя, каким мы начали
Каждую фразу, каждое слово мы не можем взять назад
Потому что со всем тем, что произошло
Я думаю, что мы оба знаем как эта история заканчивается

Потом лишь на минуту
Я хочу изменить свои мысли
Ведь мне они не кажутся верными
Хочу поднять твой дух
Хочу видеть твою улыбку, но
Знаю, что должен буду уйти

Знаю, что должен буду уйти
В последнее время, я, я думал
Хочу, чтобы ты была счастливее
Хочу, чтобы ты была счастливее

Когда наступает вечер
И я оставлен там наедине со своими мыслями
И понимание того, что ты с кем-то еще
Ну, он съедает меня изнутри
Но мы продолжаем идти по своему пути
Сделаем вид, что всё в порядке
И если сейчас мы спрыгнем вместе
Хотя бы сможем уплыть
От той аварии, коей стали причиной

После лишь на минуту
Я хочу изменить свои мысли
Ведь мне они не кажутся верными
Хочу поднять твой дух
Хочу видеть твою улыбку, но
Знаю, что должен буду уйти

Знаю, что должен буду уйти
В последнее время, я, я думал
Хочу, чтобы ты была счастливее
Хочу, чтобы ты была счастливее

Так что я уйду, я уйду
Я уйду, уйду, уйду
Так что я уйду, я уйду
Я уйду, уйду, уйду

В последнее время я, я думал
Хочу, чтобы ты была счастлива
Хочу, чтобы ты была счастлива
И даже если мне это не нравится
Я думаю, ты станешь счастливее
Хочу, чтобы ты была счастлива

Потом лишь на минуту
Я хочу изменить свои мысли
Ведь мне они не кажутся верными
Хочу поднять твой дух
Хочу видеть твою улыбку, но
Знаю, что должен буду уйти

Знаю, что должен буду уйти
В последнее время, я, я думал
Хочу, чтобы ты была счастливее
Хочу, чтобы ты была счастливее

Так что я уйду, я уйду
Я уйду, уйду, уйду"

Kuwait, Kuwait, sometimes we live in the sea
It's a beautiful tooth
His body fits into my ducks

But you do not know how to pet my insect friend
Be short, don't flirt with me, no

Yes honey, that's funny
Should we talk? Tea truck

715,I Don't Care,Ed Sheeran & Justin Bieber,"7 ContributorsGoogle Translate Sings: “I Don’t Care” by Ed Sheeran & Justin Bieber Lyrics
I'm at a fish I don't wanna be in
I'm not prepared and I have no clothes
I can face my back
Ask yourself if it's possible to buy a seat
Where is my hand?
I said to myself, ""Do you dance?"" (Satan)
Do you know that I love myself?
Is everything in life real?

Holiday does not match with confidence
Each has many words, yes
I have a lot of shape and everything, mm
We want one with fox
(What does the fox say?)

I want you to have a child
Everything was destroyed by poverty
And that man right in front of me
We can control the lightning chain
Yes, that's my son
What is your name?
Because you're still in prison, I'm sorry
Taxis in hell cost six dollars per minute
And I'm so happy with other people
We can control the lighting chain
Yes, that's my son
What is your name?

We do not want to be dinner
Terry, I do not know
I want to read my ears
This place exists
It is the disease of tension
But what I say is done
Education? Eh, it's nice for me to think about it
Find out the good things

No human contact
Yes, everyone is right, yes
I'm very happy with the animals
And you can heal him

I want you to have a child
Everything was destroyed by poverty
And that man right in front of me
We can control the lightning chain
Yes, that's my son
Yes, yes, yes, no
Because you're still in prison, I'm sorry
Taxis in hell cost six dollars per minute
And I'm so happy with other people
We can control the lighting chain
Yes, that's my son
Beyond the Gulf of Persia

But who does not love me?
Every single Jesus
But who does not love me?
Dear, this is my own business
I do not like you, you are so beautiful
God, everything
But who does not love me?
Ayyyy

I want you to have a child
Everything was destroyed by poverty
And that man right in front of me
We can control the lightning chain
Yes, that's my son
What is your name?
Because you're still in prison, I'm sorry
Taxis in hell cost six dollars per minute
And I'm so happy with other people
We can control the lighting chain
Yes, that's my son
What is your name?"

Uh
É, é

Quando eu era jovem, eu me apaixonei
Nós costumávamos dar as mãos, cara, isso é o suficiente (É)
Aí a gente cresceu, começamos a nos tocar
Costumávamos nos beijar debaixo da luz no fundo do ônibus (É)
Eu sei que o seu papai não gostava muito de mim
E ele não acreditava em mim quando eu disse que você era a garota certa
Oh, todo dia, ela achava um jeito de fugir pela janela tarde da noite

Ela costumava me encontrar no lado leste
Na cidade onde o sol não se põe
E todo dia, você sabe que a gente dá uma volta
Pelas ruelas em um Corvette azul
Meu bem, você sabe que eu só quero sair hoje à noite
Nós podemos ir para qualquer lugar que quisermos
Dirigir até a costa, pular no mar
Só pegue na minha mão e venha comigo, é

Nós podemos fazer qualquer coisa se nós focarmos nela
Pegue sua vida antiga, aí coloque uma linha nela
Meu amor é seu se você estiver disposta a tê-lo
Me dê o seu coração porque eu não vou quebrá-lo
Então venha, começando hoje
Começar uma vida nova em um lugar diferente
Nós sabemos que o amor é como todas essas ideias vieram para mim
Então meu bem, fuja comigo

Dezessete, e nós temos um sonho de ter uma família
Uma casa, e tudo entre isso
E aí, oh, de repente, nós fizemos vinte e três
E agora nós estamos pressionados para levar a nossa vida mais a sério
Nós temos nossos empregos ruins e temos contas para pagar
Nossos antigos amigos e agora nossos inimigos
E agora eu, eu estou relembrando quando eu era jovem
Na época em que eu estava me apaixonando

Ele costumava me encontrar no lado leste
Na cidade onde o sol não se põe
E todo dia, você sabe que a gente dá uma volta
Pelas ruelas em um Corvette azul
Meu bem, você sabe que eu só quero sair hoje à noite
Nós podemos ir para qualquer lugar que quisermos
Dirigir até a costa, pular no mar
Só pegue na minha mão e venha comigo, cantando

Nós podemos fazer qualquer coisa se nós focarmos nela
Pegue sua vida antiga, aí coloque uma linha nela
Meu amor é seu se você estiver disposta a tê-lo
Me dê o seu coração porque eu não vou quebrá-lo
Então venha, começando hoje
Começar uma vida nova em um lugar diferente
Nós sabemos que o amor é como todas essas ideias vieram para mim
Então meu bem, fuja comigo

Fugir agora, fugir agora
Fugir agora
Fugir agora, fugir agora
Fugir agora

Ela costumava me encontrar no lado leste

Dime algo, nena
¿Eres feliz en este mundo moderno?
¿O necesitas más?
¿Hay algo más que estés buscando?

Estoy cayendo
En todos los buenos momentos
Tengo ganas de un cambio
Y en los malos momentos me tengo miedo a mí mismo

Dime algo, nene
¿No estás cansado tratando de llenar ese vacío?
¿O necesitas más?
¿No es difícil mantenerlo bien?

Estoy cayendo
En todos los buenos momentos
Tengo ganas de un cambio
Y en los malos momentos me tengo miedo a mí mismo

Estoy fuera del profundo final
Mira como me sumerjo
Nunca me encontraré con el suelo
Choque a través de la superficie
Donde no nos pueden lastimar
Ahora estamos lejos de la superficie

Niggas been countin' me out
I’m countin' my bullets, I'm loadin’ my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin’ ’em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I’m back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get
I do not snort powder, I might take a sip
I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip
I ain’t poppin' no pill, but you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends, I love 'em to death
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit
Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist
This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift
Back when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame
It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows, it's destined to change
I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OGs, I'm thankin' you now
Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground
I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style
I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now
Fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice
I ain't do no promo, still made all that noise
This year gon' be different, I set my intentions
I promise to slap all that hate out your voice

Niggas been countin' me out
I'm countin' my bullets, I'm loadin' my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin' 'em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I'm back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel
If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck
Pistol in your hand don't make you real

I'm dead in the middle of two generations
I'm little bro and big bro all at once
Just left the lab with young 21 Savage
I'm 'bout to go and meet Jigga for lunch
Had a long talk with the young nigga Kodak
Reminded me of young niggas from 'Ville
Straight out the projects, no fakin', just honest
I wish that he had more guidance, for real
Too many niggas in cycle of jail
Spending they birthdays inside of a cell
We coming from a long bloodline of trauma
We raised by our mamas, Lord, we gotta heal
We hurting our sisters, the babies as well
We killing our brothers, they poisoned the well
Distorted self-image, we set up to fail
I'ma make sure that the real gon' prevail, nigga

I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel
If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck
Pistol in your hand don't make you real

Money in your palm don't make you real
Pistol in your hand don't make you real
Money in your palm don't make you real"
725,Drip Too Hard,Lil Baby & Gunna,"5 ContributorsTranslationsEnglishTürkçeDanskLil Baby & Gunna - Drip Too Hard (Русский перевод) Lyrics

Run that back, Turbo

Ты можешь купить самую большую сумку Chanel, если ты хочешь
Я дал им дрипа, они высосали его, я заставил их стонать
Я купил новый Patek, у меня были часы, так что я их наложил друг на друга
Принимая наркотики, я буду на ногах до утра
Это не твоя машина, ты просто арендатор, ты ей не владеешь
Если я буду в клубе, я зажигаю во время выступления
Доход доходит до меня в размере сотни
Запах galore, милое дерьмо, это всё на нас
Я из Атланты, где молодые ниггеры заправляют дерьмом
Я знаю, они ненавидят меня, но я не читаю комментарии
Каждый раз, когда я говорю ей прийти, она приходит
Каждый раз, когда на нас бычат, мы не бежим

Дрип слишком сильный, не стой слишком близко
Наебнёшься и утонешь в этой волне
Даю концерты, я был в дороге
Мне всё равно, куда я иду, пока мне платят
Плохое настроение, она была у меня на уме
Как только я возвращаюсь, ебу её как зверь
Делаю это всё время, это не удивительно
Каждую ночь снимаю с ней очередной фильм
Дрип слишком сильный, не стой слишком близко
Наебнёшься и утонешь в этой волне
Даю концерты, я был в дороге
Мне всё равно, куда я иду, пока мне платят
Плохое настроение, она была у меня на уме
Как только я возвращаюсь, ебу её как зверь
Делаю это всё время, это не удивительно
Каждую ночь снимаю с ней очередной фильм

Е, каждую вторую ночь зарабатываю доллар
Каждый вечер начинается с хорошего дня
Я чувствую себя ребенком, у меня сопли на лице
Бриллианты танцующий в циферблате, как будто на параде
Мне не нужна твоя цепочка, молодой GonWunna не раб
Я должен был провести черту, слишком много сучек были спасены
TSA донимает меня, так что я сел на частный  самолет
Эти пиздюки, вот почему я работаю над своей целью
Дрип слишком сильный (Слишком сильный), опустошаю на карточку (Карточку)
Дизайнер на земле, я едва могу произнести имена
Дрип слишком сильный, осторожно на полу
Наебнёшься и утонешь на этой волне

Дрип слишком сильный, не стой слишком близко
Наебнёшься и утонешь в этой волне
Даю концерты, я был в дороге
Мне всё равно, куда я иду, пока мне платят
Плохое настроение, она была у меня на уме
Как только я возвращаюсь, ебу её как зверь
Делаю это всё время, это не удивительно
Каждую ночь снимаю с ней очередной фильм
Дрип слишком сильный, не стой слишком близко
Наебнёшься и утонешь в этой волне
Даю концерты, я был в дороге
Мне всё равно, куда я иду, пока мне платят
Плохое настроение, она была у меня на уме
Как только я возвращаюсь, ебу её как зверь
Делаю это всё время, это не удивительно
Каждую ночь снимаю с ней очередной фильм"
726,Someone You Loved,Lewis Capaldi,"I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to hear,  somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to hear
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound till I come back around

For now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved"

729,Goodbyes,Post Malone,"Me and Kurt feel the same, too much pleasure is pain
My girl spites me in vain, all I do is complain

And I'm just like, ""Hey, are you okay?""

And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression
But I've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones

Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD)
Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Makin' that sign must've taken all night

You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
'Cause shade never made anybody less gay

Every day that I'm alive, I’ma ride with the stick
I'd rather be broke in jail than be dead and rich
Told my brothers take my breath if I turn to a snitch
But I'm 21 4L, ain’t no way I'ma switch

Break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down

Penitentiary chances just to make a couple bucks
My heart so cold I could put it in my cup
Gang vs. the world, me and my dawg, it was us
Then you went and wrote a statement, and that really fucked me up
My brother lost his life and it turned me to a beast
My brother got life and it turned me to the streets

I don't want no more comparisons
This is a marathon and I’m aware
I been playing it back from a lack of promotions
I never was one for the bragging and boasting
I guess I was hoping the music would speak for itself, but the people want everything else
Okay, no problem, I’ll show up on everyone album
You know what the outcome will be
I'm batting a thousand
It’s got to the point that these rappers don't even like rappin' with me
Fuck it 'cause my nigga 21 Savage just hit me
And told me he saved me a spot on a new record he got
He call it ""a lot,"" I open my book and I jot
Pray for Tekashi, they want him to rot
I picture him inside a cell on a cot
’Flectin' on how he made it to the top
Wondering if it was worth it or not
I pray for Markelle 'cause they fucked up his shot
Just want you to know that you got it, my nigga
Though I never met you, I know that you special
And that the Lord blessed you, don't doubt it, my nigga
Dennis Smith, Jr., stay solid, my nigga
I'm on a tangent, not how I planned it
I had some fans that hopped and abandoned ship
When they thought that I wasn't gon' pan out, I got a plan
They say that success is the greatest revenge, tell all your friends
Cole on a mission, cementin' the spot as the greatest that did it

We pop out at your party, I'm with the gang
And it's gon' be a robbery, so tuck ya chain
I'm a killer, girl, I'm sorry, but I can't change
We ain't aimin' for your body, shots hit your brain
We come from poverty, man, we ain't have a thing
It's a lot of animosity, but they won't say my name
Them killers rock with me, lil' nigga, don't get banged
'Cause they'll do that job for me while I hop on a plane"

Till she changes her mind
Says, ""Let's stay on the couch and watch TV""
And she falls asleep

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh

Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay

Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead (Uh, uh, uh)
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heartbreak

You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (Can't take back the love that I gave you)
You made my heart break (Were made outta plastic, fake)

Poor me, pour me another drink
'Cause I don't wanna feel a thing
No more, hell nah
I just wanna sip 'til the pain wears off
Poor me, pour me another round
Line 'em up and knock 'em down
Two more let's go
'Cause I ain't never hurt like this before

Don't wanna think about her
Or wear a ring without her
Don't wanna hit the karaoke bar
Can't sing without her
So make them drinks strong
'Cause brother she's gone
And if I'm ever gonna move on

I'ma need some whiskey glasses
'Cause I don't wanna see the truth
She's probably making out on the couch right now
With someone new
Yeah, I'ma need some whiskey glasses
If I'm gonna make it through
If I'ma be single
I'ma need a double shot of that heartbreak proof
And see the world through whiskey glasses
(Ain't nothing else to do, but sip around the truth)
And see the world through whiskey glasses
(I need a better view, where I don't drink to you)

Last call
I swear this will be my last call
Now I ain't drunk dialing no more at 3 am
Mr. Bartender hittin' me again

Don't wanna think about her
Or wear a ring without her

Can't sing without her

Right outside of this one church town
There's a gold dirt road to a whole lot of nothin'
Got a deed to the land, but it ain't my ground
This is God's country
We pray for rain, and thank Him when it's fallen
'Cause it brings the grain and a little bit of money
We put it back in the plate
I guess that's why they call it God's country

I saw the light in a sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine with the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country

We turn the dirt and work until the week's done
We take a break and break bread on Sunday
Then do it all again
'Cause we're proud to be from God's country (Yeah)

I saw the light in a sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine with the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country

(This is God's country)
God's country

I don't care what my headstone reads
Or what kind of pinewood box I end up in
When it's my time, lay me six feet deep
In God's country (Yeah)

I saw the light in a sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine with the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country (God's country, I saw the light)
Yeah, I saw the light in a sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine with the dogs runnin' (Yeah)
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country"
753,Be Alright,Dean Lewis,"I look up from the ground
To see your sad and teary eyes
You look away from me
And I see there's something you're trying to hide
And I reach for your hand but it's cold
You pull away again
And I wonder what's on your mind
And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake
You start to tremble and your voice begins to break
You say the cigarettes on the counter weren't your friend's
They were my mate's
And I feel the colour draining from my face

And my friend said
""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be alright""

So I still look back at all the messages you'd sent
And I know it wasn't right, but it was fucking with my head
And everything deleted like the past, yeah, it was gone
And when I touched your face, I could tell you're moving on
But it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday
It's the feeling of betrayal, that I just can't seem to shake
And everything I know tells me that I should walk away
But I just wanna stay

And my friend said
""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be okay
It's gonna hurt for a bit of time
So bottoms up, let's forget tonight
You'll find another and you'll be just fine
Let her go""

But nothing heals the past like time
And they can't steal
The love you're born to find
But nothing heals the past like time
And they can't steal
The love you're born to find

""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be okay
It's gonna hurt for a bit of time
So bottoms up, let's forget tonight
You'll find another and you'll be just fine
Let her go""

No, there ain't much, man
That ain't never let me down

Longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart
Like diamond rings and football teams have torn this boy apart
Like a neon dream, it just dawned on me that bars and this guitar
And longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart

She was a Carolina blue jean baby
Fire in her eyes that drove me crazy
It was red taillights when she left town
If I didn't know then, I sure know now

But longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart
Like diamond rings and football teams have torn this boy apart
Like a neon dream, it just dawned on me that bars and this guitar
And longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart, yeah

I don't understand these women who go around pretending
As if they really fuck with me, so I love 'em all from a distance

His body dropped down to the floor and he got teardrops in his eyes
He grabbed me by my hands and said he was afraid to die
I told him, ""It's too late, my friend, it's time to say goodbye""
And he died inside my arms, blood all on my shirt

Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

Don't you know too much already?
I'll only hurt you if you let me
Call me friend, but keep me closer (Call me back)
And I'll call you when the party's over

Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
Yeah, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

But nothin' is better sometimes
Once we've both said our goodbyes
Let's just let it go
Let me let you go

Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that"

You gotta believe me when I tell you
I said I like it like that
You gotta believe me when I tell you
I said I like it like—

Now I like dollars, I like diamonds, I like stunting, I like shining
I like million dollar deals, where's my pen? Bitch I'm signin'
I like those Balenciagas, the ones that look like socks
I like going to the jeweler, I put rocks all in my watch
I like texts from my exes when they want a second chance
I like proving niggas wrong, I do what they say I can't
They call me Cardi Bardi, banging body
Spicy mami, hot tamale
Hotter than a Somali, fur coat, Ferrari
Hop out the stu', jump in the coupe (the coupe)
Big Dipper on top of the roof
Flexing on bitches as hard as I can
Eating halal, driving the Lam'
Told that bitch I'm sorry though
'Bout my coins like Mario (Mario)
Yeah they call me Cardi B, I run this shit like cardio
Oh, damn

Diamond district in the chain (I said I like it like that)
Certified, know I'm gang, gang, gang, gang (I said I like it like—)
Drop the top and blow the brains (I said I like it like that)
Oh he's so handsome, what's his name? (I said I like it)
Oh I need the dollars (I said I like it like that)

They reload, they reload, but don't pull the trigger (pull the trigger!)
You buy all the Jordan's, fool, they gift them to me
I spend in the club (woo), what you have in the bank (yeh)
This is the new religion, bang, in Latino gang, gang, yeh
I try to diet (yeh), but in the closet I got too much fat (woo!)
I already moved the Gucci to inside my house, yeh (woo!)
Motherfucker, nobody knows you, not even in Plaza (no)
The Devil calls me but Jesus Christ hugs me (amen)
Guerrero like Eddie, long live the race (yeh)
I like Boricuas, I like Cubans 
I like the accent of the Colombians (what's going on?)
I like how she shakes the ass the Dominican (what's up?)
How good they fuck me the Venezuelans (woo!)
We are active, Perico Pin Pin (woo)
Hundred dollar bills in the briefcase (ching)
Let the bass resound, Bobby Valentin, yeh

For their itching I got Claritin
I arrive at the club and the riot begins

And don't play dumb (hey), in covers of Billboard you have seen me (hey)
I don't leave your head (woo)
Everywhere you go you have heard ""Mi Gente""
I'm not high, I'm like the Testarossa ('rossa)
I'm the one who lives it and enjoys it (enjoys it, enjoys it)
That's the thing, baby that's the thing (thing, thing)
The one who looks suffers and the one who touches enjoys (enjoys, enjoys)

Some days, things just take
Way too much of my energy
I look up and the whole room's spinning
You take my cares away
I can so over-complicate, people tell me to medicate

Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
I know that all this shit's fabricated, mmm
Time goes by and I can't control my mind
Don't know what else to try, but you tell me every time

Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin'
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin', mmm-mmm

Sometimes, it's hard to find
Find my way up into the clouds
Tune it out, they can be so loud
You remind me of a time
When things weren't so complicated
All I need is to see your face

Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
I know that all this shit's fabricated, mmm
Time goes by and I can't control my mind
Don't know what else to try, but you tell me every time

What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

Come here
Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly
You're payin'? Is the amount cleanin' you out? Am I satisfactory?
Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly
The way I'm drinkin' you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me

Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh)
Cannibal class, killing the son (Ahh)

I wanna end me

What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

Listen
Keep you in the dark, what had you expected?
Me to make you my art and make you a star
And get you connected?
I'll meet you in the park, I'll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart
'Cause I'm too expensive
It's probably somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now (Wow)
Calling security, keepin' my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now

The debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no
Then my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close
And I can't say no, I can't say no
Careful

Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)

Married to the game, I can't make you my fiancée
Bad young boss bitch, treat her like Beyoncé
But damn what them broads say, I fucked them all the first day
And that's why you trippin' anyway, like when I fuck 'em I don't pay
Even if we never speak again
I'll make sure you're ridin' in the latest Benz
Keep your business all apart if you can stay out of mine

This truck needs a half tank
These wheels need a two-lane
This radio needs three songs to play
To get me 'cross town to you
That dress needs to slip off
That hair needs to come down
Friday nights need to do
What Friday nights need to do
That's the truth

Yeah, birds need bees and ice needs whiskey
Boys like me need girls like you to kiss me
""Fishin' in the Dark"" needs Nitty Gritty
Under that pale moon
Sweet tea needs that sugar stirrin'
Small town nights need both ends burnin'
Shades need drawin', hearts need fallin'
Boots need knockin', knockin' boots
Knockin' boots, me and you, oh

Long weeks need a weekend
Cheap drinks need a-slingin'
That dance floor needs some me on you
And you on me tonight
Singalongs need to be sung
Tip bells need to be rung
Last calls need a call that cab
And backseats need I want you so bad

Yeah, birds need bees and ice needs whiskey
Boys like me need the girls like you to kiss me
""Fishin' in the Dark"" needs Nitty Gritty
Under that pale moon
Sweet tea needs that sugar stirrin'
Small town nights need both ends burnin'
Shades need drawin', hearts need fallin'
Boots need knockin', knockin' boots
Knockin' boots, girl, me and you

Doors need shuttin'
Lights need cuttin'
Lips need lockin'
Boots need knockin'

And birds need bees and ice needs whiskey
Boys like me need girls like you to kiss me
""Fishin' in the Dark"" needs Nitty Gritty
Under that pale moon
Sweet tea needs that sugar stirrin'
Small town nights need both ends burnin'
Shades need drawin', hearts need fallin'
Boots need knockin', knockin' boots
Mmm, knockin' boots, me and you, oh

Girl you know I've known you forever
How many nights we hung out together
Same little crowd, little bar, little town
Round this old dance floor
My boys are laughing and tap me on the shoulder
Making a motion like ""'Could y'all get any closer?""
They wanna know what's up why I'm still holding ya
Even when the song is over

There's a rumor going round about me and you
Stirring up our little town the last week or two
So tell me why we even trying to deny this feeling
I feel it, don't you feel it too?
There's a rumor going round, and round, and round
What d'you say we make it true?
We make it true
Oh, we make it true

Well I can shut 'em down, tell them all they're crazy
I can do whatever you want me to do, baby
Or you could lay one on me right now
We could really give them something to talk about

There's a rumor going round about me and you
Stirring up our little town the last week or two
So tell me why we even trying to deny this feeling
I feel it, don't you feel it too?
There's a rumor going round, and round, and round
What d'you say we make it true, baby?

Oh be honest girl now
Do you want to do this or not?
Should we keep them talking, girl
Or should we just make them stop?

There's a rumor going round about me and you
Stirring up our little town the last week or two
So tell me why we even trying to deny this feeling
I feel it, and you feel it too
There's a rumor going round, and round, and round

CashMoneyAP
Öldür onları, al onları, al onları, oh
Onları almaya çalışıyorum
Oh, oh al onları
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ne istiyorsun ? Dediğimi tekrarlamayacağım
Gece gelen bir hırsızım (Gece olunca hırsızım)

Bazı yanlışlar yaptım, ama her zaman haklıydım
Nasıl ateş edildiğini bildiğimi söylemiştim ve nasıl kavga edeceğimi de biliyorum
Bir defa söylemişsem yeterli, İkinci kere söylemeyeceğim
Ben fark edilemeyen biriyim, gece gelen bir hırsız gibi

Sana bebeğim dersem, sadece bir günlüğüne öylesindir
Veya sadece bir geceliğine, sen benim karım olamazsın
Bütün gece sevişmek için bir katil arıyor
Ben ise bir fahişe, tüm gece sakso çeksin bana
Saatim AP, büyük parçacıklı, ekibimle birlikte mahallemdeyim
5.000 harcadım akşam yemeğine, bir 300 de sen ateşle torbacıya

Bazı yanlışlar yaptım, ama her zaman haklıydım
Nasıl ateş edildiğini bildiğimi söylemiştim ve nasıl kavga edeceğimi de biliyorum
Bir defa söylemişsem yeterli, İkinci kere söylemeyeceğim
Ben fark edilemeyen biriyim, gece gelen bir hırsız gibi

Zenginim ama sürüyorum, alışmakta sıkıntı çekiyorum, Öfkelenip daha fazlasını kazanmak üzereyim
Böylesini görmemiştim, tonla para üstümde, Yüz binlerim çantamda bu çok tatlı bir iş
Baby OG, koşuşturuyordum bu sokaklarda, Lashawn'dan öğrendim piyasayı, ben annemin oğluyum
Gençken dinim hakkında bir şeyler öğrendim, İşlerin yürümediğini biliyordum ve kaptım elime silahı
Sırf Dior alabilmek için Paris'e gittim
Hatun ilgi için yalvarıyor, siklemiyorum onu
Huzur içinde yat Pop, keşke bizi görebilseydin
Ben ve CashMoney ne zaman gitsem buluşuyoruz
Caddelerde adamlarım gezer, beni yenemezsin
Ben olmaya çalışan bir endüstri var
Ray Charles'a gidiyorum, beni göremiyorlar
RiRi ile Rolls-Royce'dayım

Bazı yanlışlar yaptım, ama her zaman haklıydım
Nasıl ateş edildiğini bildiğimi söylemiştim ve nasıl kavga edeceğimi de biliyorum
Bir defa söylemişsem yeterli, İkinci kere söylemeyeceğim
Ben fark edilemeyen biriyim, gece gelen bir hırsız gibi

Geceleri bir hırsız gibi
Uğradım ve ona bu gecelik için D verdim
Arabanın içinde sevişmeye çalışıyor, bu kadar yeter
Koltuklarımın üstünde yapamayız çünkü beyaz renkteler (Bunlar benim koltuklarım orospu çocuğu koltuklarıma bak)
''Thriller'' klibinde gibi yaşıyorum hayatı sadece gece vakti dışarı çıkıyorum
Hatun likör kullanmıyor, içkili olmayı sevmiyor
Hatun Hennesy içmiyor, sadece beyaz şarap
Patlattım Pinot Grigio marka şarabı
Porsche ile yanaşıyorum, yanımda fena bir kaltak
Porshce'u park edip Lambo'ya atlıyorum
İniyorum, Major Payne, kamuflaj giyiniyorum
Sevimli hatunu sevişmeye zorladım, sevgilisini bıraktı
Ateş etmeyi ve seni sevindirmeyi severim, ben Ramboyum
Cuban Chain elmaslarla dolu, boynumu boğuyor adeta
Huzur içinde yat Pop, ölümün yaktırdı bana bir cigara

Bazı yanlışlar yaptım, ama her zaman haklıydım
Nasıl ateş edildiğini bildiğimi söylemiştim ve nasıl kavga edeceğimi de biliyorum
Bir defa söylemişsem yeterli, İkinci kere söylemeyeceğim
Ben fark edilemeyen biriyim, gece gelen bir hırsız gibi"

Her song is on and she's spinnin' around, yeah
She got me drunk like Corona
Heart racin' like it's Daytona
Ooh, I'm in Heaven, I swear, right now

And those eyes can hypnotize
Was designed to blow my mind

Look what God gave her, how perfect He made her
She walks in the room, it's like He answered my prayers
The way that she moves, how could anybody blame her?
I know she's got haters, but it ain't her fault, nah
Look what God gave her

It's like I heard angels singin'
Like she came down from the ceilin'
When she walked in here this evenin', I thought, yeah
That girl one in seven billion
Got everyone in here feelin'
Like there's a fire in this buildin', so hot

Got a smile on her angel face
I know I'll never lose my faith

Look what God gave her, how perfect He made her
She walks in the room, it's like He answered my prayers
The way that she moves, how could anybody blame her?
I know she's got haters, but it ain't her fault, nah
Look what God gave her

Got that look in her eyes
Swear she fell right out the sky
Yeah, I think I've seen the light
Every kiss, I could die
It's like the heavens opened wide
Man, I swear I've seen the light

Look what God gave her, how perfect He made her
She walks in the room, it's like He answered my prayers
The way that she moves, how could anybody blame her?
I know she's got haters, but it ain't her fault, nah
Look what God gave her

You ain't feelin' them downtown lights
But I got a bottle at your favorite place
Just waitin' for us in a bucket on ice
Damn, I didn't think it'd be that easy
'Cause now you're gettin' ready
I'm just sittin' here watchin' TV
Here you come lookin' like a grown man's dream
Damn, I can't believe, I can't believe

I talked you into slippin' down the hall, baby, turnin' on
Your playlist you play when you're in the shower
Talked you into taking up my time, making up your mind
Switching back and forth for an hour
And now you're lookin' like a line from a Vandross song
I'm looking at that fine little dress you got on
Don't get me wrong, girl, I love it
Now I just wanna talk you out of it

Yeah, as cool as it would be
Watchin' people wonder who you are
Oh, we should just say we did, we can start with a kiss
And pretend we just got back from the bar

I talked you into slippin' down the hall, baby, turnin' on
Your playlist you play when you're in the shower
Talked you into taking up my time, making up your mind
Switching back and forth for an hour
And now you're lookin' like a line from a Vandross song
I'm looking at that fine little dress you got on
Don't get me wrong, girl, I love it
Now I just wanna talk you out of it

Yeah, it's a little cold outside
Music's probably way too loud
To hear you laugh
And there's a look in your eyes
Looks like we ain't leavin' now

I talked you into slippin' down the hall, baby, turnin' on
Your playlist you play when you're in the shower
Talked you into taking up my time, making up your mind

We've been to both Carolinas
Seen a big Montana sky
Driven up and down a coast a few times
London, Paris, paradise
But ain't got much memory of the scenes
Come to think, I miss them all
And damn, babe, it's all your fault

No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there, girl, I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No, there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
With my eyes on you (With my eyes on you, with my)
With my eyes on you (With my eyes on you, with my)

Speakin' of the coast, remember Pfeiffer beach?
You and me, that sunset, cliffs by the sea
And the night rolled in
And you still talk about that moon that I can't recall
But God, I saw all I needed to
Might as well have stayed in the room

No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there, girl, I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No, there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
With my eyes on you, yeah (With my eyes on you, with my)
Yeah, with my eyes on you (With my eyes on you, with my)

Don't you remember Times Square?
And people countin' down everywhere
2000-whatever, no, I didn't care
'Cause, baby, you were there
And once again, couldn't help but stare

No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there, girl, I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No, there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
Halfway around the world
Or the local corner booth
Yeah, you guessed it, girl, you know I got my eyes on you
We could be on any street
Any party, any room
I'll be there all night with my eyes on you

Don't matter where we've been
No, there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you"

We don't need anyone else
Let our bodies do the talking
Let our shadows paint the wall

We'll hide away in the dark
Slip your hand in my back pocket
Go and let your long hair fall
I want you all to myself

I'm jealous of the song that you've been singing

Ik ben een motherfuckin' ramp
Ik wil niet te veel zijn
Maar ik wil je aanraking niet missen
En het lijkt alsof jij geen fuck geeft
Ik wil je niet laten wachten
Maar ik doe wat ik moet doen
En ik ben misschien niet degene voor je
Maar als je zo doorgaat heb je straks geen meisje meer

Want ik weet dat we zo moeilijk doen
Maar we zijn zo verliefd, het is ongelooflijk
Ik kan niet krijgen wat ik wil, maar jij ook niet

Je bent mijn vriendje niet (Vriendje)
En ik ben je meisje niet (Meisje)
Maar jij wil niet dat ik andere jongens zie
En ik wil niet dat je iemand anders ziet
Maar je bent mijn vriendje niet (Vriendje)
En ik ben je meisje niet (Meisje)
Maar jij wil niet dat iemand anders me aanraakt
Schat, we hoeven het niemand te vertellen

Zelfs al ben je niet van mij, ik beloof je dat de manier waarop we ruziën
Me laat voelen of we net verliefd zijn
Want, schat, als puntje bij paaltje komt
Damn, schat, ik ben ook een ramp, ook (Ook)
Ik word gek als het over jou gaat
Ik neem mijn tijd met degene die ik kies
En ik wil niet lachen als het niet door jou komt

Want ik weet dat we zo moeiijk doen
Van je houden maakt me gek
Want ik kan niet krijgen wat ik wil, maar jij ook niet

Maar jij wil niet dat iemand anders me aanraakt
Schat, we hoeven het niemand te vertellen

Ik wil je zoenen (Yeah), ik wil je niet missen (Yeah)
Maar ik kan niet bij je zijn, want ik heb problemen
Ja, op het oppervlak lijkt het makkelijk
Voorzichtig met woorden, maar het is nog steeds moeilijk om me te begrijpen
Veel stress als het vertrouwen laag is (Mmm)
Slechte gevoelens, waar is het leuke gebleven? (Oh)
Probeer je open te stellen en meer liefde te geven (Meer liefde)
Probeer je open te stellen en meer liefde te geven

Als je mijn vriendje was
En jij mijn meisje
Zou ik waarschijnlijk niemand anders zien
Maar ik kan dat niet beloven in mijn eentje

En ik ben je meisje niet (Meisje, ik ben je meisje niet)

Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

Let go, I got a feeling that it's time to let go
I said so, I knew that this was doomed from the get-go
You thought that it was special, special
But it was just the sex, though, the sex, though
And I still hear the echoes (The echoes)

Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up

I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now

Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word ""goodbye""?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side

My junior popped him and left him lopsided, yeah, yeah
We spin his block, got the rebound, Dennis Rodman
Fool me one time, you can't cross me again
Twelve hundred horsepower, I get lost in the wind
If he talkin' on the yard, the pen' dogs'll take his chin
Maybach SUV for my refugees
Buy blocks in the hood, put money in the streets
I was solo when the opps caught me at the gas station
Had it on me, thirty thousand, thought it was my last day
But they ain't even want no smoke
If I had to choose it, murder what she wrote

We're in the homestretch of the hard times
We took a hard left, but we're alright
Yeah, life sure can try to put love through it, but
We built this right, so nothing's ever gonna move it

When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it rain 'cause you and I remain the same
When there ain't a crack in the foundation
Baby, I know any storm we're facing
Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good

Call it dumb luck, but baby, you and I
Can't even mess it up, yeah, though we both tried
No, it don't always go the way we planned it
But the wolves came and went and we're still standing

When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it rain 'cause you and I remain the same
When there ain't a crack in the foundation
Baby, I know any storm we're facing
Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good
When the bones are good

Bones are good, the rest, the rest don't matter (Baby, it don't really matter)
Paint could peel, the glass, the glass could shatter (Oh, the glass, oh, the glass could shatter)
Bones are good, the rest, the rest don't matter (Ooh)
Paint could peel, the glass, the glass could shatter (Yeah)

When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it rain (Let it rain, let it rain)
'Cause you and I remain the same (Woo)
When there ain't a crack in the foundation (Woo)
Baby, I know any storm we're facing
Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good

809,Someone You Loved,Lewis Capaldi,"I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to hear,  somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to hear
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound till I come back around

For now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved"

I hope you're both feelin' sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me

Yeah, babe, I hope she shows up in a 2 AM pic from her friend
Hanging on to a guy and you just ain't him
I hope you stay up all night all alone, waitin' by the phone
And then she calls
And baby, I, I hope you work it out
Forgive and just about forget
And take her on a first date again
And when you lean in for a kiss

I hope you're both feelin' sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy

I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me

Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear

But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see

820,Before You Go,Lewis Capaldi,"I fell by the wayside like everyone else
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, but I was just kidding myself
Our every moment, I start to replace
'Cause now that they're gone, all I hear are the words that I needed to say

When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal, but this won't

So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'da known you had a storm to weather
So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So before you go

Was never the right time whenever you called
Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all
Our every moment, I start to replay
But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face

When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal, but this won't

So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'da known you had a storm to weather
So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So before you go

Would we be better off by now
If I'da let my walls come down?
Maybe, I guess we'll never know
You know, you know

Before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'da known you had a storm to weather
So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless

You can't hurt my feelings, but I like pain
If he fuck me and ask ""Whose is it?""
When I ride the dick, I'ma spell my name, ah

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, you fuckin' with some wet-ass pussy
Bring a bucket and a mop for this wet-ass pussy
Give me everything you got for this wet-ass pussy
Now from the top, make it drop, that's some wet-ass pussy
Now get a bucket and a mop, that's some wet-ass pussy

Mustard sur l'instru, garce

Je mets de nouvelles Forgianos sur ma Jeep
Je charbonne jusqu'à c'que les semelles rouge-sangs soient acquises
Car tous mes négros s'en sont sortis des rues
Je garde une centaine en cash dans mes jeans
Je m'en rappelle de parcourir le centre commercial avec l'équipe entière
Maintenant un négro n'arrive pas à répondre aux appels parce-que j'empoche gros
Je me réveillais, empochant des liasses de bon matin
J'étais fauché, là j'suis riche, et ces négros sont amers

Toute cette haute couture sur mon corps m'ont fait déraper, déraper, ayy
Sorti droit des affaires sombres, je suis un grand Crip
Si j'ai un pot de lean, je vais siroter, siroter
Je fais s'envoler les liasses avec ma reine comme Lauren et Nipsey
Mais je me suis enrichi sur tous ces négros, je ne l'ai pas oublié, ça
J'ai dû y aller en trimant, je n'ai pas oublié ça
Je saute dans la Maybach maintenant je peux m'asseoir à l'arrière
Ces salopes me connaissent maintenant parce-que je leur jette de grosse liasses
Parce-que je me fais de l'argent maintenant, je sais que tu as entendu ça
Un jeune négro dans l'angle, salope, j'ai dû servir du crack
L'oncle m'a avancé de l'argent, j'ai dû lui ramener des filles de joie en retour
On a gravi avec de l'argent sale, j'ai dû l'nettoyer au lavabo
J'ai débranché le cerveau et ai acheté à ma compagne un nouveau coupé
Qu'importe si t'es du Yah Gang ou si t'es un SuWoop
J'ai une salope de la Nouvelle Orleans et mec, cette chatte c'est indescriptible
Et je suis ce négro maintenant, qui l'aurait sû ?

Je mets de nouvelles Forgianos sur ma Jeep
Je charbonne jusqu'à c'que les semelles rouge-sangs soient acquises
Car tous mes négros s'en sont sortis des rues
Je garde une centaine en cash dans mes jeans
Je m'en rappelle de parcourir le centre commercial avec l'équipe entière
Maintenant un négro n'arrive pas à répondre aux appels parce-que j'empoche gros
Je me réveillais, empochant des billets de bon matin
J'étais fauché, là j'suis riche, et ces négros sont amers

Je me suis levé pour empoché l'argent, whoa, whoa
J'ai une sombre salope, son cul est tatoué, whoa, whoa
Givenchy jusqu'à mes pieds, paire de jumelles, je les baise toutes deux
J'enfile une nouvelle Audemars, paillettes comme sur un bâteau
J'étais sollicité sur ma queue, où vous étiez bande de négros ?
Je sais que tu m'as tourné le dos juste pour te faire quelques billets
Maintenant tu fais une embardée, parce-que je suis dans la Maybach noire
De nouveaux diamants sur moi, nique un éblouissement, c'est pas du Snapchat
Parce-que je me faisais payer
Des diamants canaris qui ressemblent à de la limonade
Je dégote à la mère d'mon gosse cette nouvelle Bentayga
J'essaie d'obtenir le Dojo comme un Sensei, ouais
Des parapluies Rolls Royce comme je suis sous la pluie
Je m'occupe juste de mes affaires
J'ai des frères qui ont purgé leur peine, je plaisante pas
Les autres rappeurs en parlent juste, moi je le vis
Je m'élève, je n'ai pas de limite de ciel, ouais, ouais, ouais

Je mets de nouvelles Forgianos sur ma Jeep
Je charbonne jusqu'à c'que les semelles rouge-sangs soient acquises
Car tous mes négros s'en sont sortis des rues
Je garde une centaine en cash dans mes jeans
Je m'en rappelle de parcourir le centre commercial avec l'équipe entière
Maintenant un négro n'arrive pas à répondre aux appels parce-que j'empoche gros
Je me réveillais, empochant des billets de bon matin
J'étais fauché, là j'suis riche, et ces négros sont amers

Je, ayy, ouais
J'empochais gros, petit négro
Maintenant regarde-moi m'enrichir sur ces négros
Ouais, maintenant regarde-moi m'enrichir sur ces négros
Maintenant regarde-moi m'enrichir sur ces négros
Maintenant regarde-moi m'enrichir sur ces négros, ouais, ouais"

Catch a little air when we cross the tracks
Sipping on something from a paper sack
You hang your shirt on that maple limb
Slipping through the moon to the river bend
Wasn't very long I was jumping in, jumping in
I guess I'm still doing now what I was doing then

Chasin' you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasin' you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasin' that freedom, chasing' that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasin' that you and me, I only see in my rearview
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasin' you, still chasin' you

You always used to talk about LA
I heard you got as far as Santa Fe
Well you know I tried to track you down
I only got as far as Guitar Town
Singing about a girl I used to know, used to know
Well you should know that I haven't given up
I'm just on your radio

Chasin' you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasin' you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasin' that freedom, chasin' that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasin' that you and me, I only see in my rearview
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasin' you, still chasin' you

Chasin' you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasin' you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasin' that freedom, chasin' that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasin' that you and me, I only see in my rearview
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasin' you, still chasin' you

Still chasin' you, still chasin' you"

Jason Derulo, ah
Savage love (685, baby)

If I woke up without ya, I don't know what I would do
Thought I could be single forever 'til I met you
Usually, don't be fallin', be fallin', fallin' fast
You got a way of keepin' me comin' back-to-back
I just found out, the only reason that you lovin' me
Was to get back at your ex-lover, but before you leave
Usually, I would never, would never even care
But, baby, I know you're creepin', I feel it in the air

Every night and every day
I try to make you stay
But your

Savage love
Did somebody, did somebody break your heart?
Lookin' like an angel, but your savage love
When you kiss me, I know you don't give two fucks
But I still want that

Your savage love
Your savage lo-lo-love
Your savage lo-lo-love
You could use me
'Cause I still want that (Your savage love)

Baby, I hope that this ain't karma 'cause I get around
You wanna run it up, I wanna lock it down
Usually, don't be fallin', be fallin', fallin' fast
You got a way of makin' me spend up all my cash

Every night and every day
I try to make you stay
But your

Savage love
Did somebody, did somebody break your heart?
Lookin' like an angel, but your savage love
When you kiss me, I know you don't give two fucks
But I still want that

Your savage love
Your savage lo-lo-love (Ooh)
Your savage lo-lo-love
You could use me
'Cause I still want that, your savage love

(La-la-la-la, ooh, la-la-la-la) Your savage lo-lo-love
(Ooh, la-la-la-la, ooh, la-la-la-la, ooh) Your savage lo-lo-love

Baby

Savage love (Oh, girl)
Did somebody, did somebody break your heart?
Lookin' like an angel, but your savage love (Savage love)
When you kiss me, I know you don't give two fucks
But I still want that

Your savage love (Savage love)
Your savage lo-lo-love (Ooh, yeah)
Your savage lo-lo-love
Girl, you could use me
'Cause I still want that, your savage love"

That girl know what she want, she make me take it off when she see me (Let's go)
She say I make her wet whenever my face pop up on TV
I had to say, ""No disrespect, gotta do it safe or you can keep it""
Pop star, I'm fresh up out the trap and I'm going Bieber
She know I'm a call away, she can drop a pin and I'd come meet her
Stand next to me, you gon' end up catchin' a fever (Yeah, yeah)

Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

Tired of beefin' you bums, you can't even pay me enough to react
Been wakin' up in the crib and sometimes I don't even know where I'm at

Anytime that I ran into somebody, it must be a victory lap, ayy
Shawty, come sit on my lap, ayy, they sayin' Drizzy just snap
Distance between us is not like a store, this isn't a closeable gap, ayy

842,Death Bed,Powfu,"2 ContributorsDeath Bed by Powfu - Tagalog Version by Cesar $emento LyricsLagi akong masaya kapag ikaw kasama ko, parang ayoko ng matapos ang araw pag ganito
Parang sayo nalang kasi umi-ikot ang mundo ko, diko inaasahan to na darating sa buhay ko
Hindi dahil sa itchura kaya kita ginusto
Pinagtagpo talaga tayo’t pinana ni kupido
Sa kabaitan mong taglay lalo kita na ginusto, grabe ka den mag alaga kasi yan ang tipo
Wag kang mag a-alala susuklian ko yan lahat, sayo palang kasi ay kuntento na ako’t sapat
Mga problemang dumaan at pagsubok na  ka harap, pangako ko sayo sa altar tayo’y haharap
At bubuong isang pamilya sama-samang masaya, wala tayong iwanan sa hirap man o sa ginhawa
Hindi pa sigurado  pero ako’y pursigido, gusto kita makasama tumanda hanggang sa dulo

2nd
Nalulungkot ako kapag hindi ka na kasama, namimiss kita palagi pag hindi ka nakikita
Pasensya kana love kung minsan kitang nasaktan, piliin natin ang ayusin wag natin pakawalan
Tao lang naman kasi tayo at nagkakamali
Di maiwasan ang mali kahit alam nangang mali

Kaya patawad na mahal sa mga nagawang mali, hayaan mo akong muli at sayo na makabawi
Papa-alala ko sayo kung pano ka sumasaya, nuong nag sisimula palang nun tayong dalawa
Nag haharutan sa daan at magka hawak ang kamay, grabe kapa nun tumawa ang lakas mong mag ingay
At kapag napagod ka mag hahanap ng upuan, di buo ang araw mo pag di ako napag tripan
Ang sarap lang balikan kung ano nakaraan, yung pinaramdam mo saakin di yan mahihigitan"

I want to serve the Senate
I guess the viking can be very close
Oh, do not touch the cat, heck, huh, la la la
Ooh, need to wake up, ooh, you're still asleep

Located in Orlando
Acute bleeding from the beginning is hot water, I'm taking a shower
He didn't know his name
I'm sorry, it's completely meaningless, that does not exist
Kuwait, Kuwait, sometimes we live in the sea
It's a beautiful tooth
His body fits into my ducks
Everything is wet, yes, yes

I want to serve the Senate
I guess the viking can be very close
Yes, no no no no, oh no God
Ooh, I want to run away
Oh, snoring knows Norita, dead
I want to get out of the house safely
Oh, do not touch the cat, heck, huh, la la la
Ooh, need to wake up, ooh, you're still asleep

Saved me at the hotel, there are jobs that don't change anyone
He did not claim to be a lover of Pastirago
But you do not know how to pet my insect friend
Be short, don't flirt with me, no

Yes honey, that's funny
Should we talk? Tea truck
Dear, you killed a child
Standby mode

I want to serve the Senate
I guess the viking can be very close
But there is a wall, the real story is la la la la la la la la la la la la la
Ooh, I want to run away
Oh, snoring knows Norita, dead
I want to get out of the house safely (Get out of this house safely)
Hi, there is something wrong with you, the real story is la la la la la la la la la la la la la
Ooh, need to wake up, ooh, you're still asleep

Wait, wait for me (Hey, wait up)
We hope this makes sense (No, it doesn't)
Call my name, I'm my dad
The wine has arrived, the wine has arrived, the wine has arrived

Duh you, duh you, duh you
Ooh, need to wake up, ooh, you're still asleep"

Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical

So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

I'm the bad guy

I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know

So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm only good at bein' bad, bad
I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean, I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne

Only thing I need to know is if you wet enough

You keep playin', not another day with you, shorty
Mismatched fits, that was way before you know me
Got a lot of love, well, you better save it for me

We play games of love to avoid the depression

I'ma put my heart on ice, heart on ice, it's gettin' the best of me

While in the cell with Lil' Hakeem, after I slapped him I had told him
""I don't know how you get down with them clowns but I'm a soldier""
No one could understand, I had way too much aggression
That built over the years from my abandoned adolescence
See I done been lied to, backstabbed, and heartbroken
I wanted to cry but I was too afraid to open
Prayin’ one day I’d find a peace of mind by the ocean
I spent all my time committing crimes to get closer
While at my nana house I play the couch, starin' at the ceiling
Tryin’ not to get in my feelings
Thinkin' of a way I could make these millions

Во-о-о-у, ах
О-о, оу-о-у, о (Mello сделал всё на высшем уровне, ах)

Я стараюсь быть всюду и сразу
Но порой все старания впустую
Я стараюсь быть всюду и сразу
Но порой все старания впустую
Я молюсь Богу, чтобы он указал мне путь (Ах)
И, может быть, однажды я буду чего-то стоить
Я благодарю Бога за то, что он свёл меня с тобой
Полагаю, я прошёл через Ад не зря
Я всегда лажаю и всё порчу
Кажется, я стал мастером в этом
Я предлагаю тебе свою любовь
Надеюсь, ты примешь её как лекарство
Ведь ты говоришь мне, что нет никого лучше меня
Но мне кажется, что это не так
Надеюсь, ты видишь во мне только лучшее
И в итоге я стану лучше

Я не хочу все испортить
Такая любовь редко приходит ко мне
Я не хочу все испортить
Такая любовь редко приходит ко мне
Я не хочу все испортить
Такая любовь редко приходит ко мне
Я не хочу все испортить
Такая любовь редко приходит ко мне

Я не хочу все испортить
Такая любовь редко приходит ко мне
Я не хочу все испортить
Такая любовь редко приходит ко мне

Мы принимаем наркотики, и ты прижимаешься ко мне
Я рассказываю тебе, как ты дополняешь меня
Но иногда мне кажется, что тебе нравится быть одной
И ты говоришь, что я должен был остаться в комнате
Наверное, я ошибался всё это время, это моя вина
Мои ошибки, скорее всего, затмевают всё хорошее
Но пришло время оставить их все позади
Выше голову, детка, держись крепче, впереди долгая жизнь

Я не хочу все испортить
Такая любовь редко приходит ко мне
Я не хочу все испортить
Такая любовь редко приходит ко мне
Я не хочу все испортить
Такая любовь редко приходит ко мне
Я не хочу все испортить
Такая любовь редко приходит ко мне

Я не хочу все испортить
Такая любовь редко приходит ко мне

Were you in the living room, chillin', watchin' television?
It's been a year now, think I've figured out how
How to let you go and let communication die out

I know, you know, we know you weren't
Down for forever and it's fine
I know, you know, we know we weren't
Meant for each other and it's fine

But if the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
You'd come over and you'd stay the night
Would you love me for the hell of it?
All our fears would be irrelevant
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
The sky'd be falling and I'd hold you tight
And there wouldn't be a reason why
We would even have to say goodbye
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right? Right?
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right? Right?

I tried to imagine your reaction
It didn't scare me when the earthquake happened
But it really got me thinkin', the night we went drinkin'
Stumbled in the house and didn't make it past the kitchen
Ah, it's been a year now, think I've figured out how
How to think about you without it rippin' my heart out

You'd come over and you'd stay the night
Would you love me for the hell of it?
All our fears would be irrelevant
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
Sky'd be falling while I hold you tight
No, there wouldn't be a reason why
We would even have to say goodbye
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
You'd come over, right?
You'd come over, you'd come over, you'd come over, right?
Mm

I know, you know, we know you weren't
Down for forever and it's fine

858,One Man Band,Old Dominion,"13 ContributorsOne Man Band Lyrics
Been flyin' solo for so long
Nobody's singin' the harmony
Up there just me and my shadow
No bass, no guitar, no tambourine

And I found you like a melody
You were singin' in the same key as me
We had ‘em dancin' in the streets

I don't wanna be a one man band
I don't wanna be a rolling stone, alone
Puttin' miles on a run-down van
Baby, we can take our own show on the road
I'll lay down the beat, you'll carry the tune
We'll get tattoos, and we'll trash hotel rooms
Baby, take my hand
I don't wanna be a one man band
No

I wanna run down your wild dreams
And I wanna chase every high with you
Count every rip in these old jeans
We'll never learn how to sing the blues

If I'm gonna be famous
Girl, I wanna be famous with you
We got our own little groove

I don't wanna be a one man band
I don't wanna be a rolling stone, alone
Puttin' miles on a run-down van
Baby, we can take our own show on the road
I'll lay down the beat, you'll carry the tune
We'll get tattoos, and we'll trash hotel rooms
Baby, take my hand
'Cause I don't wanna be a one man band

When the spotlight goes cold, and the curtains come down
The chairs are all stacked, and there's no one around
And nobody's payin', we’ll still be playin'

I don't wanna be a one man band
I don't wanna be a rolling stone, alone
Puttin' miles on a run-down van
Baby, we can take our own show on the road
I'll lay down the beat, you'll carry the tune
We'll get tattoos, and we'll trash hotel rooms
Baby, take my hand
'Cause I don't wanna be a one man band
I don't wanna be a one man band"

Before you came along
I could go all alone

Good, feeling good

Ayy, feeling good, like I should
Went and took a walk around the neighborhood
Feeling blessed, never stressed
Got that sunshine on my Sunday best (Yeah, ayy, ayy)

Every day can be a better day, despite the challenge
All you gotta do is leave it better than you found it
It's gonna get difficult to stand, but hold your balance
I just say whatever 'cause there is no way around it 'cause

Everyone falls down sometimes
But you just gotta know it'll all be fine
It's okay, uh-huh-huh, uh
It's okay, it's okay

Ayy, feeling good like I should
Went and took a walk around the neighborhood
Feeling blessed, never stressed
Got that sunshine on my Sunday best (Ayy)

Some days you wake up and nothing works, you feel surrounded
Gotta give your feet some gravity to get you grounded
Keep good things inside your ears just like the waves and sound did
And just say whatever 'cause there is no way around it

Everyone falls down sometimes
But you just gotta know it'll all be fine
It's okay, uh-huh-huh, uh
It's okay, it's okay

Ayy, feeling good, like I should
Went and took a walk around the neighborhood
Feeling blessed, never stressed
Got that sunshine on my Sunday best
Ayy, feeling good, like I should
Went and took a walk around the neighborhood
Feeling blessed, never stressed
Got that sunshine on my Sunday best"
861,Godzilla,Eminem,"Ugh, you're a monster

I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I'll feel like Godzilla
Better hit the deck like the card dealer
My whole squad's in here, walking around the party
A cross between a zombie apocalypse and B-Bobby ""The
Brain"" Heenan which is probably the
Same reason I wrestle with mania
Shady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up
Consider it to cross me a costly mistake
If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia
ADHD, Hydroxycut
Pass the Courvoisier (Hey, hey)
In AA with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate
Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday (Ayy)
This beat is cray-cray, Ray J, H-A-H-A-H-A
Laughing all the way to the bank, I spray flames
They cannot tame or placate the

Monster
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet

I'm just a product of Slick Rick and Onyx, told 'em lick the balls
Had 'em just appalled, did so many things that pissed 'em off
It's impossible to list 'em all
And in the midst of all this
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal, voices whisper
My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on the guy with a missile launcher
I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological
Quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of vodka
When you twist the top of the bottle, I'm a

Monster
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers

Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet

If you never gave a damn (Ayy), raise your hand
'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans
I'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is
The motherfuckin' finger (Finger), prostate exam ('Xam)
How can I have all these fans and perspire?
Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flyer
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers
And what goes around comes around just like the blades on the chainsaw
'Cause I caught the flack, but my dollars stacked right off the bat like a baseball
Like Kid Ink, bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy
'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake, yeah)
Bitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher
Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her
Face in my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez
Cristhian Rivera, 'cause my lyrics never sit well
So they wanna give me the chair
Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Hari Kari
'Cause e'ry Tom and Dick and Harry carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary on 'em
Swearing up and down they can spit, this shit's hilarious
It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column
We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem
Get the shaft like a steering column (Monster)
Trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink
Evil half of the Bad Meets
Evil, that means take a back seat
Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi single
Look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people
Is my 'Gangsta Bitch' like Apache with a catchy jingle
I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em
Other words, I Minute Maid 'em
I don't wanna hurt 'em, but I did, I'm in a fit of rage
I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade
I'm finna kill 'em and dump all their fuckin' bodies in the lake
Obliterating everything, incinerate a renegade
I'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill
I'm Attila, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla
You're bringin' the killer within me outta me
You don't wanna be the enemy of the demon who entered me
And be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be
Every bit of me's the epitome of a spitter
When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck
Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me
A hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me
I'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you, bitch, I'm unfadable
You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowin' up like an inflatable
I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable
I'm on the toilet bowl, I got a trailer full of money and I'm paid in full
I'm not afraid to pull a—

Man, stop
Look what I'm plannin', haha"

Забавно, что трек, вообще не звучит так, как мы только что фристайлили
О, е
Я просто хочу красивых сучек
Самых красивых, те сучки — самые красивые, а, а
Когда я употребляю молли, я жесткий
А, я говорю, а

Мне не нужно Молли, чтобы я был жёстким, а
Когда я под Молли, я чувствую себя жёстким, а, а
Она является определением красивой сучки
Украл её, я являюсь определением бандита, а, эй
Мне нужно Молли, чтобы я был жёстким, а, эй
Но когда я под Молли, я чувствую себя жёстким
Она является определением красивой сучки
Украл её, я являюсь определением бандита

Убираю перки и беру экстази, экстази, экстази
Томми в этом Томми Хилфигер, —фигер, —фигер
Этот Томми выстреливает в ниггера, Томми Хилфигер, нахуй ниггеров
Я классный, когда под таблетками, мне она нравится
Я не курю сканк, но этой ночью буду под наркотой, нигга
Наливаю кодеин и добавляю Молли в стакан
Я знаю, что она ёбнутая, ага, ей это понравится
Она — моя липучка, ага, похоже я прилип к ней
Я погружаюсь в нее, будто в воду моряк, мне нравится трахать её
Зависимый от ее личных вещей, мне нужно сказать ей это
Я чувствую это, будто гадалка
Твой бывший ниггер был хорош, но я могу быть лучше
Красивая сучка из леса, думаю, она охотница
Думаю, она убийца и едок, она Джеффри Дамер
Я могу понять, когда она находится в себе, я могу читать её, будто книгу
Нет ни Тека, ни Беретты, ни FN направленного на меня, я правильно понял?
Е, е, е

Мне не нужно Молли, чтобы я был жёстким, а
Когда я под Молли, я чувствую себя жёстким, а, а
Она является определением красивой сучки
Украл её, я являюсь определением бандита, а, эй
Мне нужно Молли, чтобы я был жёстким, а, эй
Но когда я под Молли, я чувствую себя жёстким, а, а
Она является определением красивой сучки
Украл её, я являюсь определением бандита

Мой бро подметил ее, она красивая сучка, думаю о ней
Она не должна слышать, что я жесткий, однажды заполучив сучку, я начинаю владеть ей
Я знаю, у нее есть стиль, а у меня есть деньги, так что я хочу ее
Видишь эту пушку 4-5 калибра у меня в штанах, наставлю тебе её на заж, зажму на братана
Девчонка, она наездница с Глоком, наставленным на неё
И девчонка, я умру здесь без стояка
Если у нас проблемы, мы избавляемся от
Положил 20 тысяч в твой кошелек, мы собираемся делать деньги
Я являюсь определением бандита
Забрал твое сердце из его рук и до сих пор не говорю всякую грязь
Новые киллеры в моем округе, тебе следует убежать
Это грязная пушка с калибром .38, эта сучка наносит урон
Закидываюсь колёсами, 4K Trey, позвони, когда приземлишься с грузом
Я разрешу тебе заехать к моим бро, где они будут лежать с этим
Я обработал эту сучку, я открываю банку с этим
Нахуй АК-47, я налечу с рукопашкой

Мне не нужно Молли, чтобы я был жёстким, а
Когда я под Молли, я чувствую себя жёстким, а, а
Она является определением красивой сучки
Украл её, я являюсь определением бандита, а, эй
Мне нужно Молли, чтобы я был жёстким, а, эй
Но когда я под Молли, я чувствую себя жёстким, а, а
Она является определением красивой сучки
Украл её, я являюсь определением бандита"

This weekend or next?
And hey, how do you get a red wine stain
Out of your favorite dress?

How does he sleep at night?
Mama, the nerve of this guy
To leave me so easy
Am I gonna be alright?
I wanna kick myself for falling so hard
Mama, can you die from a broken heart?

Can you ask Daddy if he's got time
To come and look at my front door?
It got slammed last night
And now it don't close right
And just promise that you won't tell him everything
And keep that pistol in the drawer
Mama, please don't say
I'm gonna laugh about this someday
You didn't see the way he drove away

How does he sleep at night?
Mama, the nerve of this guy
To leave me so easy
Am I gonna be alright?
I wanna kick myself for falling so hard
Mama, can you die from a broken heart?
Oh, a broken heart

Can your knees give out from prayin' so hard? (Prayin' so hard)
Can you go blind from crying in the dark? (In the dark)
Was it ever really real
If he don't feel like I feel?

How does he sleep at night?
Mama, the nerve of this guy
To leave me so easy
Am I gonna be alright?
How does he sleep at night?

Busy at the crib, cookin' salmon with the lobster

Bodyguards don't look like Kevin Costner, you tweakin'
Just pulled up to Whitney Houston, Texas for the evenin'
They tell the same story so much, they start to believe it
The ones that start like, ""Drizzy's shit was cool, but we even""
Man, how the fuck?
Two, four, six, eight watches, factory, so they appreciate
Crown in my hand and I'm really playin' keep-away
Shit don't even usually get this big without a Bieber face
Naw, naw, piece of cake, naw, naw, Turks and Caic', yeah, yeah
Go and get your friends, we can sneak away, yeah, yeah
Yeah, I keep a, like I keep the faith
Wonder how I got this way? Swear I got the

Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick (Ah)
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click

'Cause I just want you here tonight (Ooh)
Holding on to me so tight (Ooh)
What more can I do?
Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

Oh, all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere (So brightly, baby)
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air (Oh, oh yeah)
And everyone is singing (Oh yeah)
I hear those sleigh bells ringing (Oh)
Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need? (Yeah, oh, oh)
Won't you please bring my baby to me?

If you're one of them girls, 'cause I'm one of them boys
Would trade his whole world, hm, yeah
For one of them girls who likes to act all quiet, sexy, not even tryin'
Yeah, you know I ain't lyin', damn right
You one of them girls, broke every heart in your hometown
On the day you rode out, got 'em all wishin' on stars now

Ayy
I saw your sister at work
I saw your mama at church
I'm pretty sure I saw your car at the mall
I see your face in the clouds
I smell your perfume in crowds
I swear your number's all my phone wants to call

It's kinda funny how I can't seem
To get away from you
It's almost like you don't want me to

You've got a cold heart and the cold hard truth
I got a bottle of whiskey, but I got no proof
That you showed up tonight
In that dress just to mess with my head
So much for so long
Out of sight, out of mind
Girl, you're lookin' so good
It's drivin' me out of mine
Oh, you're breakin' my heart
Baby, you're playin' hard to forget

Told me to leave all your things
Out on the porch, on the swing
You'd come and grab 'em by the end of the week
Well, it's just some jeans and a shirt
But it's a whole lot of hurt
I think I know why you've been dragging your feet

Ain't it funny how I can't seem
To get away from you?
It's almost like you don't want me to

You've got a cold heart and the cold hard truth
I got a bottle of whiskey, but I got no proof
That you showed up tonight
In that dress just to mess with my head

Everybody here ain't from here
But we're here doin' our thing
Lettin' go a little, little by little
Sippin' on a frozen drink

Tiki bars tik'n, pourin' all weekend
Clouds ain't leakin' no rain
Two pieces shakin', white caps a-breakin'
We ain't feelin' no pain, it goes like

One margarita, two margarita, three margarita, shot
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow, leave all your sorrow out here on the floatin' dock
When that sun lays down, we'll be on our way
One more barefoot round, one more last chance to say
""Hey, señorita, don't you think we need a salt and a Buffett song?""
One margarita, two margarita, three margarita, we'll be gone

Ice blue skies, shades on the eyes
To tuck the bloodshot away
Hair of the dog, shouldn't take long
But who cares, we got all day
Palm trees a-leanin', sunburn screamin'
But we'll all be alright, after

One margarita, two margarita, three margarita, shot
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow, leave all your sorrow out here on the floatin' dock
When that sun lays down, we'll be on our way
One more barefoot round, one more last chance to say
""Hey, señorita, don't you think we need a salt and a Marley song?""
One margarita, two margarita, three margarita, we'll be gone

We'll be gone

Tiki bars tik'n, pourin' all weekend
Clouds ain't leakin' no rain
Two pieces shakin', white caps a-breakin'
We ain't feelin' no pain, feelin' no pain

One margarita, two margarita, three margarita, shot
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow, leave all your sorrow out here on the floatin' dock
When that sun lays down, we'll be on our way
One more barefoot round, one more last chance to say
""Hey, señorita, don't you think we need a salt and a Chesney song?""

We'll be gone

Took her out of Follies 'cause her pussy pop

Chanaynays and Birkins, she cannot decide (Chanaynay)

Actin' like they the ones created this and they get all the drip from my guys

Princess cut diamonds, they Cartier, yeah
Cartier bag for the Cartier thot

Cartier jeans, ain't no way I can sag
Ain't no way I'ma ever gon' go out bad
I can't go out, no way, I won't go out
I just grip on her ass and I show out
I sit like a champ and I wait on a hold-out
I just whip up a new Chanel Patek
I whip with the wrist and I don't break the door out

I said I don't love you a little too late
But I guess there ain't ever a right time
And I don't know why it's called a goodbye
Go run my name into the ground
Tell everyone you know just how
How I slammed the door on our forever
But I promise you it's for the better

I hope you find what you were lookin' for
I hope your heart ain't hurtin' anymore
And you get movin' on, all figured out
And you don't hate me somehow
'Cause I hope you're happy now

Who knew this heart could break this hard
Or a love like ours could fall apart
Without so much as a warnin'
I thought that I was what you wanted

Well, I guess you found what you were lookin' for
I guess my heart ain't worth it anymore
I'm a wreck, I'm a mess
And I ain't got nothin' left
And so I hope you're happy now

I ripped it up and flushed with the tissue, try to forget you
I ain't got nothing against you, we human, we all got issues
But I'm tired of being tired of being tired
That part of me done died
I see it, then I don't, act like I'm blind
I'm confident it won't be one of mine
I know emotions come with lies, so I tell the truth all the time
Ain't got no sympathy for no bitch
I admit that I'm rich and I'm lit
Jumpin' up on stages, I get two hundred an occasion
Bro had really fucked the game up, we made niggas shut they trap down
They see how I made it, I'm the reason they won't rap now
See me out in traffic, make a hater pull his hat down
The biggest OGs salute me, a stylist can't even style me
The robbers probably wanna get me, I'm hoppin' out Lamborghinis
The youngins turn in my city, they try me, I get it cracking
Some of this still would happen if I never had started rapping
My people them still steady trapping and they still be getting active
I tell 'em to chill, I'm tryna run up these M's
Paid cash and then he post the crib (Nah)
I can't show nobody where my mama live, that's how I 'posed to feel
My niece just asked me were my diamonds real, I said, ""Of course""
I just played the hand that I was dealt, didn't have to force
All around the world they know it's me, they hear my voice
And I done it all in a pair of Diors, yeah

You know what it was, I told you that I was heartless
I'm emotionally scarred, that ain't even your fault
But don't listen to them haters tryna fill your ears with salt

All this revenue coming in, I'll probably never spend
I just bought my BM a Benz, now that's another Benz
I just cut off all of my friends and brought my brothers in
I don't see nobody but me, who I'm gon' lose to?
I can't move around without tools, these niggas loose screws
I can see me taking the lead over the new school
They remember me from selling weed at my old school
Only hit it once and now it's old news
Blew up, who the fuck would knew? Paint my Trackhawk Nipsey Blue
If I get one, you get one too, I really move how bosses move
I never call myself a GOAT, I leave that up to the people
Everybody can't go to the top, I had to leave some people
I'ma be forever scheming, woke up, I thought I was dreaming
Watched my lil' boy play with toys, I just dropped a tear of joy
Some shit that I feel for
I been going crazy with that scoring, call me Baby Harden
They say I'll be great, I guess I'm waiting for it

875,The Bigger Picture,Lil Baby,"Protests and growing national outcry continues over the death of George Floyd (Section 8 just straight cooked this motherfucker up)
Last night, people protesting in Minneapolis escalated
As demonstrators were lashed by tear gas and rubber bullets
The main message here, the main message here, the main message here
Is that they want to see those officers involved
They want to see those officers arrested
Officers arrested
(I can't breathe, I can't breathe)

Trade my 4x4 for a G63, ain't no more free Lil Steve
I gave 'em chance and chance and chance again, I even done told them please
I find it crazy the police'll shoot you and know that you dead, but still tell you to freeze
Fucked up, I seen what I seen
I guess that mean hold him down if he say he can't breathe
It's too many mothers that's grieving
They killing us for no reason
Been going on for too long to get even
Throw us in cages like dogs and hyenas
I went to court and they sent me to prison
My mama was crushed when they said I can't leave
First I was drunk, then I sobered up quick
When I heard all that time that they gave to Taleeb
He got a life sentence plus
We just some products of our environment
How the fuck they gon' blame us?
You can't fight fire with fire
I know, but at least we can turn up the flames some
Every colored person ain't dumb and all whites not racist
I be judging by the mind and heart, I ain't really into faces
Fucked up, the way that we livin' is not getting better, you gotta know how to survive
Crazy, I had to tell all of my loved ones to carry a gun when they going outside
Stare in the mirror whenever you drive
Overprotective, go crazy for mine
You gotta pay attention to the signs
Seem like the blind following the blind
Thinking 'bout everything that's going on
I boost security up at my home
I'm with my kind if they right or they wrong
I call him now, he'll pick up the phone
And it's five in the morning, he waking up on it
Tell 'em wherever I'm at, then they comin'
I see blue lights, I get scared and start runnin'
That shit be crazy, they 'posed to protect us
Throw us in handcuffs and arrest us
While they go home at night, that shit messed up
Knowing we needed help, they neglect us
Wondering who gon' make them respect us
I can see in your eye that you fed up
Fuck around, got my shot, I won't let up
They know that we a problem together
They know that we can storm any weather

It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear

Fuck it, I'm goin' on the front line
He gon' bust your ass if you come past that gun line
You know when the storm go away, then the sun shine
You gotta put your head in the game when it's crunch time
I want all my sons to grow up to be monsters
I want all my daughters to show out in public
Seems like we losing our country
But we gotta stand up for something, so this what it comes to
Every video I see on my conscience
I got power, now I gotta say somethin'
Corrupted police been the problem where I'm from
But I'd be lying if I said it was all of them
I ain't do this for the trend, I don't follow them
Altercations with the law, had a lot of them
People speaking for the people, I'm proud of them
Stick together, we can get it up out of them
I can't lie like I don't rap about killing and dope, but I'm telling my youngins to vote
I did what I did 'cause I didn't have no choice or no hope, I was forced to just jump in and go
This bullshit is all that we know, but it's time for a change
Got time to be serious, no time for no games
We ain't takin' no more, let us go from them chains
God bless they souls, every one of them names

It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear

They trainin' officers to kill us, then shootin' protestors with these rubber bullets
They regular people, I know that they feel it
These scars too deep to heal us
What happened to COVID? Nobody remember
It ain't makin' sense, I'm just here to vent
It happen to one of your people, it's different
We get it, the system is wicked, just learn how to pick it
Knowledge is power, I swear I'm a witness, I know that I'm gifted
I won't go too deep 'cause I'm scared they'll get me
Ain't scared to admit it, some shit I can't mention
It's people who can, well, here's the chance
I won't take the stand, but I'll take a stand for what I believe
Must not be breathing the air that I breathe
You know that the way that I bleed, you can bleed
I never been a fan of police
But my neighborhood know I try to keep peace
So it's only right that I get in the streets
March for a reason, not just on GP
Our people died for us to be free
Fuck do you mean? This was a dream
Now we got the power that we need to have
They don't want us with it and that's why they mad, yeah

It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here

Hey, evet

Ah

Bir yerlere bağlanan biri değilim
Bir yanlışında kapı dışarısın bebeğim
Sözlerim kulağa çılgınca gelse de umurumda değil
Ama beni yarı yolda bırakmazsın, hayır, hayır
İşte bu yüzden sabah olduğunda burada
Hala yatağında yatıyor, ve şöyle diyor olacağım;

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Bunca vaktimiz var
Planları iptal edebilir
Burada bir ömür kalabilirim

Öyleyse kapıyı kilitle ve anahtarı at
Artık buna karşı gelemezsin, sadece sen ve ben
Ve hiçbir şeyim yok, yapabilecek hiçbir şeyim yok
Sana takılıp kaldım, Sana takılıp kaldım, Sana takılıp kaldım
Hadi devam et ve çıldırt beni
Bebeğim, konuş bakalım, değişmem asla
Seninle takılıp kalmayı, seninle takılıp kalmayı, seninle takılıp kalmayı
Sana takılıp kaldım, Sana takılıp kaldım, Sana takılıp kaldım, bebeğim

Olmamız gereken başka bir yer yok, hayır, hayır, hayır
Seni daha iyi tanıyacağım
Umarım sonsuza kadar buradayızdır
Sokaklarda kimse yok
Bana dünyanın sonunun geldiğini söyleseydin
Vaktimi geçirecek daha iyi bir yol olamazdı

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Devam et, aklımı başımdan al
Bu gece burada ihtiyacımız olan her şeye sahibiz

Keep me safe 'cause there's monsters right outside
Daddy, please don't go, I don't wanna be alone

Just 'cause I'm leavin'
It don't mean that I won't be right by your side
When you need me
And you can't see me in the middle of the night
Just close your eyes and say a prayer

But I'll always be right there
Even though I'm leavin', I ain't goin' nowhere

Dad, we'll be late, and Uncle Sam don't like to wait
He's got a big old plane that's gonna take me far away
I know I act tough, but there's a churnin' in my gut
'Cause I just can't call you up when things get rough
Before I left, he hugged my neck and said

Just 'cause you're leavin'
It don't mean that I won't be right by your side
When you need me
And you can't see me in the middle of the night
Just close your eyes and say a prayer
It's okay, I know you're scared I might be here
But I'll always be right there
Even though you're leavin', I ain't goin' nowhere

Daddy, I'm afraid, won't you stay a little while?
I never thought I'd see the day I had to say goodbye
Daddy, please don't go, I can't do this on my own
There's no way that I can walk this road alone

I might be better on my own
I hate you blowin' up my phone
I wish I never met your ass
Sometimes it be like that
But I'm not myself the nights you're gone
There ain't no way I'm movin' on
I'm not afraid to need you bad
Sometimes it be like that

We both wanna love
We both wanna slide
We both wanna argue until we're both right
And you want a hug
I kiss you goodnight
Maybe we're both just out of our mind (Ooh)
And you throw tantrums while I'm twistin' up
No medicine is fixin' us
Can't tell you why but tell you what
You got me thinkin'

I might be better on my own
I hate you blowin' up my phone
I wish I never met your ass
Sometimes it be like that
But I'm not myself the nights you're gone

I'm not afraid to need you bad (Bad)
Sometimes it be like that

I cross the seas wit' you (Hey, seas)
Wasn't even supposed to be wit' you (Yeah, be)
Yeah, and it gets crazy in the night
I cannot sleep with you (Sleep with you)
And I could keep you nice and warm (Ayy)
Won't do no thinking, I'm in love (Yeah, yeah)
If I was to give you the world (Yeah)
That's anything that you can think of (Of)

Got too much goin' to be upset
I swear I'd rather be your friend

There ain't no way I'm movin' on
I'm not afraid to need you bad (Bad)
Sometimes it be like that

Sometimes, when you thought you found the love of your life (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Now you're thinkin' I'm just one of those guys, leading on
I can't help when you read it wrong
Don't know why I trip on us
You put me down, I pick you up
Can't tell you why but tell you what (You should know that)
You got me thinkin'

I might be better on my own
I hate you blowing up my phone
I wish I never met your ass
Sometimes it be like that
But I'm not myself the nights you're gone
There ain't no way I'm movin' on
I'm not afraid to need you bad

Sometimes when you're fallin' off track
Baby, don't you leave me like that
Don't cry

All those little moments are every reason why

I'm homesick

But out here singin' 'bout you, baby, all I'm thinkin' 'bout

Yeah,  I'm a turner
I turn pages all the time
Don't like where I'm at
34  was bad, so I just turn to 35
Yeah,  I'm a keeper
I keep digging down for the deep
Like  the records I'm playing
They might keep you waiting
But you know I'm only playing for keeps

And if the house just keeps on winning
I  got a wildcard up my sleeve
And if love keeps giving me lemons
I'll just mix 'em in my drink
And if the whole wide world stops singing
And all the stars go dark
I'll keep a light on in my soul
Keep a bluebird in my heart

Ooh
Ooh

Well, I'm a giver
Yeah, and I'm still giving 'em hell
Forgiving's pretty hard
So I made an art out of forgettin' 'em well
Yeah, I'm a rhymer
I can turn 20 cents into a 10
And if I get confused and I start to lose
I rhyme a dime 'til it all makes sense

And if the house just keeps on winning
I got a wildcard up my sleeve
And if love keeps giving me lemons
I'll just mix 'em in my drink
And if the whole wide world stops singing
And all the stars go dark
I turn a light on in my soul
And keep a bluebird in my heart

Ooh

And if the house just keeps on winning
I got a wildcard up my sleeve
And if love starts giving me lemons

I can't breathe (Chopsquad), I can't breathe, 999
Waiting for the exhale
I toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well

I can't breathe, I'm waiting for the exhale
Toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well
Still no luck, but oh well
I still try even though I know I'm gon' fail
Stress on my shoulders like a anvil
Perky got me itching like a anthill
Drugs killing me softly, Lauryn Hill
Sometimes I don't know how to feel

Ring-ring, phone call from depression
You used my past and my memories as a weapon
On the other line, I talk to addiction, huh
Speaking of the devil, all the drugs, I miss them
This can't be real, is it fiction?
Somethin' feels broke, need to fix it
I cry out for help, do they listen?
I'ma be alone until it's finished

This is the part where I tell you I'm fine, but I'm lying
I just don't want you to worry
This is the part where I take all my feelings and hide 'em
'Cause I don't want nobody to hurt me

I can't breathe, I'm waiting for the exhale
Toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well
Still no luck, but oh well

Drugs killing me softly, Lauryn Hill
Sometimes I don't know how to feel

Sometimes I don't know how to feel
Let's be for real
If it wasn't for the pills, I wouldn't be here
But if I keep taking these pills, I won't be here, yeah
I just told y'all my secret, yeah
It's tearing me to pieces
I really think I need them
I stopped taking the drugs and now the drugs take me

This is the part where I tell you I'm fine, but I'm lying
I just don't want you to worry
This is the part where I take all my feelings and hide 'em
'Cause I don't want nobody to hurt me

I can't breathe, I'm waiting for the exhale

892,Does to Me,Luke Combs,"17 ContributorsDoes To Me Lyrics
I was a third-string dreamer on a second-place team
But I was hell on wheels with a full head of steam
When coach put me in
And I'm still proud of that hit
I was a last resort to go to prom with the queen
Thanks to an ex-boyfriend who broke her heart that week
No, I didn't get lucky
But I still felt like a king
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving, average Joe
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

I was the one phone call when my brother went to jail
Pawned my guitar just to pay his bail
No, I'll never get it back
But I'm okay with that
I was the first man standing next to my best friend
The day the love of his life said ""I do"" to him
I was a couple beers deep
But I still remembered that speech
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving, average Joe
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

There's a worn-out blade that my granddaddy gave me
My mama's first Bible, Daddy's Don Williams vinyl
That first-fish-catching Zebco thirty-three
Well, that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving average Joe (Average Joe)
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And I'm a damn hard working
One thing's for certain
I stand up for what I believe (For what I believe)
That might not mean much to you
But it does to me
Yeah, it does to me
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

Oh, it does to me
Oh man, it does to me"

Girl, our mamas are best friends and so are we
The whole town's rooting for us like the home team
Most likely to settle down
Plant a few roots real deep and let 'em grow
But we can't stop this real world from spinnin' us
Your bright lights called, I don't blame you for pickin' up
Your big dream bags are all packed up and ready to go
But I just need you to know

That I love you more than a California sunset
More than a beer when you ain't twenty-one yet
More than a Sunday morning Lord
Turnin' some poor lost souls 'round, and Hallelujah bound
Yeah, I love you more than the feeling when the bass hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl at the end of the book
But, baby, this might be the last time I get to lay you down
'Cause I can't love you more than my hometown

I ain't the runaway kind, I can't change that
My heart's stuck in these streets like the train tracks
City sky ain't the same black
Ain't that a map dot shame, man, to think that

I love you more than a California sunset
More than a beer when you ain't twenty-one yet
More than a Sunday morning Lord
Turnin' some poor lost souls around, and Hallelujah bound
Yeah, I love you more than the feeling when the bass hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl at the end of the book
But, baby, this might be the last time I get to lay you down
'Cause I can't love you more than my hometown

Yeah, you got a wild in your eyes that I just wasn't born with
I'm a same gas station cup of coffee in the mornin'
I need a house on the hill, girl, not in 'em
So hang onto these words 'til them avenues help you forget 'em

'Cause I love you more than a California sunset
I love you more in a twenty-dollar sundress
Hate that loaded down car you got your keys in
Girl, but I hate even more that you're leavin'
'Cause I love you more than the feeling when the bass hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl at the end of the book
But that ain't you and me so I guess I'll see you around
'Cause I can't love you more than my hometown

Love you more than my hometown

Love you more, baby, love you more"

Candy paint with the windows all black
Seats crème brûlée, what they gon' say?
With the top down screamin', ""Money ain't a thing""
And we up 'til six in the mornin'
When the sun rise, we be on it
Ooh, I got five, you know it's all live
Tell me when to go, baby, when we gon' slide?
Baby, when we gon' slide? Hey, huh
Up all night, baby, when we gon' slide? Yeah
Up all night, baby, when we gon' slide? Oh
Up all night, baby, when we gon' slide? Uh

Fuckin' up the seats of the brand new ride"

You want to play, and then this bitch going down (It's goin' down)

I'ma lay him down like he in the lounge

Walk 'em down, walk 'em down
Walk 'em down, walk 'em down
Walk 'em down, walk 'em down
Walk 'em down, walk 'em down

Walk down on 'em in Balenciaga runners
My blood slime a nigga out just like an anaconda
You go against me, then you fucked just like a used condom (You fucked, yeah)
I roll 'em up and then I smoke 'em like some good ganja, ayy (I smoke 'em up, yeah)
Still doing drive-bys, but I wanna walk 'em (I wanna)
If I can't find 'em, you know I'm gonna stalk 'em (I gotta stalk 'em)

Nigga, I was posted on the corner where the J's at
Roll up in the four by four, pull up at the corner store
And I got red in my drink when I pour up soda
I remember prayin' that the feds never take the Motorola
Choppa got the chopper, make 'em do a backflip
Pay my dawg a dime to walk him down, he need the racks, bitch
I been drinkin', I been taking all this codeine to the face
Got a lot of M's in the safe
Caught a murder, then I beat the case
I was just about to do the race

I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time

You want me, I want you, baby

I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy
I see us written in the stars
We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never

Te conocí una vez bajo la luna de Piscis
Mantuve mi distancia porque sé que
No te gusta cuando estoy con alguien más
No pude evitarlo, te hice pasar por el infierno

No sé por qué me escapo, oh chico (Escapo, oh sí; sí)
Te hago llorar cuando me escapo (Escapo, oh; oh)

Chico, llévame de vuelta porque quiero quedarme

You keep playin', not another day with you, shorty
Mismatched fits, that was way before you know me
Got a lot of love, well, you better save it for me

We play games of love to avoid the depression
We been here before and I won't be a victim

Why you always in a mood?

904,Good 4 U,Olivia Rodrigo,"(Ah)

Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world?
(World)
And good for you, I guess that you've been workin' on yourself
I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better man for your brand-new girl (Girl)

Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

Well, good for you, I guess you're gettin' everything you want (Ah)
You bought a new car and your career's really takin' off (Ah)
It's like we never even happened
Baby, what the fuck is up with that? (Ah)
And good for you, it's like you never even met me
Remember when you swore to God I was the only
Person who ever got you? Well, screw that, and screw you
You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do

Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask

Or maybe you never cared at all

We could kiss and just cut the rubbish
Then I might bе onto somethin'
I ain't givin' you one in public
I'm givin' you hundreds, fuck it
Somethin' we just gotta get into
Sign first, middle, last on the wisdom tooth
Niggas wishin' that the pussy was a kissin' booth
Taste breakfast, lunch, and gin and juice
And that dinner just like dessert too
And when we French, refresh, give me two
When I bite that lip, come get me too
He want lipstick, lip gloss, hickeys too, huh

And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about

'Cause how could I ever love someone else?

And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do

Can't drive past the places we used to go to

I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing
Over all the noise

Bein' annoying, singin’ in harmony
I bet she's braggin' to all her friends, sayin' you're so unique, hmm

So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused
That was our place, I found it first
I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she’s with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Ah) Hmm
Do you get déjà vu, huh?

Do you call her, almost say my name?
’Cause let's be honest, we kinda do sound the same
Another actress
I hate to think that I was just your type
And I bet that she knows Billy Joel
’Cause you played her ""Uptown Girl""
You're singin' it together
Now I bet you even tell her how you love her
In between the chorus and the verse (Ooh; I love you)

So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it’s all reused
That was the show we talked about
Played you the songs she's singing now when she's with you

Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space

Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark

Usually, I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me

In Hollywood, layin' on the screen

You can't fight it, you can't breathe

You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I say goodbye

When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that

A cold beer's got twelve ounces
A good truck's got maybe three hundred thousand
You only get so much until it's gone
Duracells in a Maglite
A needle drop on a forty-five
Are the kinda things that only last so long

When the new wears off, and they get to gettin' old
Sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all

The FM station on the outskirts
Blue jeans after years of shift work
All fadin' out like I always knew they would
The strings on this guitar
The first love lost on a young heart
Those things are gonna break after the getting's good

'Cause the new wears off and they get to gettin' old
Yeah, sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all


They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
And I know there'll be that moment
The good Lord calls one of us home and
One won't have the other by their side
But Heaven knows it, that won't last too long
Maybe some things last forever after all

After all"

You know my ex, so that makes it all feel complicated, yeah

I read those texts that you sent to yours, but I'll never say it, yeah
(I'll never say—)

You walked in my life at 2 a.m.
'Cause my boy's new girl is your best friend
Act like you don't see me, we'll play pretend
Your eyes already told me what you never said
Now we're in the backseat of the black car, goin' home
When she asked me, ""Is it wrong if I come up with you?""
We're both drunk on the elevator
When I kiss you for the first time in New York City, uh

I swear to God, I never fall in love
Then you showed up and I can't get enough of it
I swear to God, I never fall in love
I never fall in love, but I can't get enough of it (Yeah)

First off, I'm not sorry, I won't apologize to nobody
You play like I'm invisible, girl, don't act like you ain't saw me
Last year was a mess and how I acted was beyond me
But the past still revolves me, you text me, I ain't responding
But now shit's done changed
Go our separate ways
But look at this damage you did to me
I still want nothin' to do between you and me
Please don't say nothin', it all sounds untrue to me
We don't got nothin' to say, hey

I swear to God, I never fall in love
Then you showed up and I can't get enough of it
I swear to God, I never fall in love
I never fall in love, but I can't get enough of it (Yeah)
I swear to God (I swear to God), I never fall in love
Then you showed up and I can't get enough of it (I can't get enough of you)
I swear to God (I swear to God), I never fall in love (In love)
I never fall in love, but I can't get enough of it (I can't get enough of it, yeah)

You know my ex, so that makes it all feel complicated, yeah

(D-D-Daytrip took it to ten, hey)
Bebe geri döndü, ayy, çifte değerli, ayy
Onun çifte Grammy'leri, çifte plaketleri, ayy
Bu bir gerçek, ayy, salla kalçayı, ayy
Salla kalçayı, ayy

Ve bu da şampiyonlar için
Başladığımdan beri kaybetmedim, evet
Bunun son olduğunu söylemeniz çok komik, evet
Sonra yine yaptım, evet

Sana uzun zaman önce yolda söylemiştim
Bekledikleri şeyi aldım
Hiçbir şeyden kaçmam, peşini bırakmam
Askerlerini kap gel ve onlara gizlenmediğimi söyle
Zaten beni hiç desteklememiştin
Tekrar zirveye çıktığımda, senin şunu dediğini duymak istiyorum
Hiçbir şeyden kaçmıyor, kaçmıyor
Askerlerini kap gel ve onlara molanın bittiğini söyle

Ah, yapmam gerekiyor, ah
Bu albümü bitirmem gerekiyor
Birkaç bir numaraya ihtiyacım var
Her şarkıda bir plakete ihtiyacım var
Şimdi Nicki'yle bir tanesine ihtiyacım var
Bir rap zencisine sizi görmediğimi söyle, hah
Ben Bieber gibi pop zencisiyim, hah
Ben sürtükleri becermem, ben ibneyim, hah
Ama bu zenciler Madea gibi kaltaklar, evet, evet, evet, ayy (Evet)
Oh, hadi yapalım
Düşmedim, sadece yeni şeylerimi piyasaya sunmadım
Ünlü oldum, şimdi herkes beni dava etmeye çalışıyor
Siz bana Nas diyorsunuz, ama mahallem bana Doobie diye sesleniyor, evet

Ve bu da şampiyonlar için
Başladığımdan beri kaybetmedim, evet
Bunun son olduğunu söylemeniz çok komik, evet
Sonra yine yaptım, evet

Sana uzun zaman önce yolda söylemiştim
Bekledikleri şeyi aldım (Bekledikleri şeyi aldım)
Hiçbir şeyden kaçmam, peşini bırakmam
Askerlerini kap gel ve onlara gizlenmediğimi söyle (Sürtük, hiçbir yerden kaçmıyorum)
Zaten beni hiç desteklememiştin (Ooh, ooh)
Tekrar zirveye çıktığımda, senin şunu dediğini duymak istiyorum
Hiçbir şeyden kaçmıyor, kaçmıyor
Askerlerini kap gel ve onlara molanın bittiğini söyle (Evet)

Sicilim o kadar temiz ki, beni ezip geçmek için sabırsızlanıyorlar
Fazla hızlı parlamış olmalıyım, dünyanın beni gazlamasına izin vermemeliydiniz (Woo)
Artık çok geç çünkü burada kalıcıyım ve bu kızlar benim edepsiz olduğumu biliyor (Mmm)
Onu erkek arkadaşına, kıçındaki el izimle geri gönderdim
Tüm şehir konuşuyorken, notlar alıyoruz
Söyle onlara, paylaşıma devam etsinler
Keşke öldürebilse, ama yaklaşamaz bile yanıma
Üstadım o kadar gurur duyuyor ki benle, kadehini kaldırırken boğazı düğümleniyor
Ben senin kontrol edemeyeceğin türden biriyim, yapacağımı söyledim, sonra da yaptım
Söylentileri aydınlatmam (Ayy), espri anlayışınız nerede? (Ayy)
Şaka yapmaktan bıktım çünkü bebek boomer'lar gibi yaşlandılar
Haterlarımı tüketicilere çevirdim, eskilere kendilerini küçük enişte gibi hissettiriyorum (Küçük)
Zamanının yaklaştığını söyle, ama tıpkı Oklahoma gibi (Mmm)
Benim zamanım daha erken geliyor (Mmm), ben sadece geç büyüdüm (Mmm)
Lisede zirve yapmadım, hala buradayım ve daha da şirinleşiyorum (Woo)
Tüm bu sosyal ağlar ve bilgisayarlar
Bu amcıklar ezik değillermiş gibi etrafta dolaşıyor

Sana uzun zaman önce yolda söylemiştim
Bekledikleri şeyi aldım (Bekledikleri şeyi aldım)
Hiçbir şeyden kaçmam, peşini bırakmam
Askerlerini kap gel ve onlara gizlenmediğimi söyle (Sürtük, hiçbir yerden kaçmıyorum)
Zaten beni hiç desteklememiştin (Ooh, ooh)
Tekrar zirveye çıktığımda, senin şunu dediğini duymak istiyorum
Hiçbir şeyden kaçmıyor, kaçmıyor
Askerlerini kap gel ve onlara molanın bittiğini söyle (Evet)

Evet
Ben endüstrinin bebeğiyim, mmm
Ben endüstrinin bebeğiyim
Evet"

Your world's an ideal

We're on different lines, so I
Wanna be nice enough, they don't call my bluff
'Cause I hate to find
Articles, articles, articles
Rather you remain unremarkable (Got a lotta)
Interviews, interviews, interviews
When they say your name, I just act confused

Did you have fun?

I gotta spoil my baby with an upgrade (Yeah)
Ayy, ayy, ayy

Yeah, we fancy like Applebee's on a date night
Got some Bourbon Street steak with the Oreo shake
Get some whipped cream on the top, too
Two straws, one check, girl, I got you
Bougie like Natty in the styrofoam
Squeaky-squeakin' in the truck bed all the way home
With some Alabama-jamma, she my Dixieland delight (Hey)

My new, clean blue jeans without the holes in 'em
Country kisses on my lips without  the Skoal in 'em

Maybe a little Maybelline but she don't need it
In the kitchen light, radio slows down
Boxed wine, then her up-do goes down

Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winnin'
I ain't jokin', do it sound like I'm kiddin'?
I been makin' like two thousand a minute
So high up through the clouds, I was swimmin'
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it
And we might have a child when I'm finished

Uh, I won't love a ho, after we fuck, she can't get near me
Only bitch I give a conversation to is Siri
My pants Amiri, yes, I'm winnin', clearly
I'm the chosen one, seen my potential, so they fear me
Lately I've been prayin', God, I wonder, can You hear me?
Thinkin' 'bout the old me, I swear I miss you dearly
Stay down 'til you come up, I've been stickin' to that theory
Every day a battle, I'm exhausted and I'm weary
Make sure I smile in public, when alone, my eyes teary
I fought through it all, but that shit hurt me severely
I've been gettin' high to hide behind my insecurities
Takin' different pills, but I know it ain't gon'—

They say I'm Pac rebirth, never put out a weak verse
Homicides when we lurk, I'ma step 'til my feet hurt
Been puttin' them streets first
White tees turned burgundy t-shirts
Lookin' for somethin' real, he stuck in a deep search
Anxiety killin' me, I just want to leave Earth
When they ask if I'm okay, it just make everything seem worse
Try and explain your feelings, sound like something you rehearsed
Stabbed me in my back with a clean smirk
Lookin' so deep into your eyes, I can read your thoughts, so
Shut the fuck—, I mean, please don't talk
I done been through too much and I don't need another loss
Put that on every war scar for every battle I fought

Uh, copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag
Like fuck it, I'ma count while I'm in it

Rufst mich ständig an
Ich hab' dir schonmal gesagt, dass es zu Ende ist, lass mich in Ruhe
Weiß, dass es dich verletzt, mich gehen zu sehen
Dunkle Wolken, du wirst mich stürmen sehen
Ich werd' nicht zurückgeh'n
Aber vertrau mir, du wirst das halten
Das halten (Mhh, mhh)

Dich jetzt aus meinem Kopf bekommen
Ich bekomm' dich jetzt nicht aus meinem Kopf
Ich bekomm' dich jetzt nicht aus meinem Kopf
Ich bekomm' dich jetzt nicht aus meinem Kopf (Mhh, mhh)
Ich bekomm' dich jetzt nicht aus meinem Kopf
Ich bekomm' dich jetzt nicht aus meinem Kopf
Ich bekomm' dich jetzt nicht aus meinem Kopf
Ich bekomm' dich jetzt nicht aus meinem Kopf (Mhh, mhh)

Ich versuch', diese Spiele nicht mehr zu spielen
Ich möchte deinem Namen nicht mehr schreiben
Ich versuch', diesen Schmerz nicht mehr zu spüren
Mädchen, es tut mir leid, aber meine Gefühle sind nicht mehr die gleichen (Nein)
Warst mein Homie, du bist nicht mehr Gang (Nein)
Ich bin kein Nigga mehr, den du beanspruchen kannst (Nein)
Traumatisiert, hoff', dass es nicht mehr regnet
Du hast mich durch ein paar Sachen gebracht, die meine Aura verändert haben
Jetzt um die ganze Welt, ich erkunde sie, keine Dora
Neue Bitch, vielleicht werd' ich sie in Dior einkleiden
Arsch dick, Kleine ist heiß, kein Florida
Hübsch und macht es für sich selbst, ich applaudier' ihr
Keine Bedürfnisse, yeah, ich red' über meinen Schatz
Also bitte, lass mich allein, ich bin durch
Und das alles nur wegen dem, was du angefangen hast
Ich hab' dir gesagt, dass du verlieren wirst (Mhh)

Rufst mich ständig an
Ich hab' dir schonmal gesagt, dass es zu Ende ist, lass mich in Ruhe (Brrt)
Weiß, dass es dich verletzt, mich gehen zu sehen
Dunkle Wolken, du wirst mich stürmen sehen
Ich werd' nicht zurückgeh'n (Go back)
Aber vertrau mir, du wirst das halten
Das halten (Mhh, mhh)

Dich jetzt aus meinem Kopf bekommen (Uhh, wow)
Ich bekomm' dich jetzt nicht aus meinem Kopf (Ja, ja)
Ich bekomm' dich jetzt nicht aus meinem Kopf (Meinem Kopf)
Ich bekomm' dich jetzt nicht aus meinem Kopf (Mhh, mhh; okay)
Ich bekomm' dich jetzt nicht aus meinem Kopf (Woah)
Ich bekomm' dich jetzt nicht aus meinem Kopf (Woah)
Ich bekomm' dich jetzt nicht aus meinem Kopf
(Yeah)
Ich bekomm dich jetzt nicht aus meinem Kopf (Mhh, mhh)

Ich will keine Spiele mehr spielen, meine Liebe
Ich bin einzigartig, kann mich nicht nachahmen, meine Liebe
Erdbeben, lass etwas wackeln, meine Liebe
Die meisten von ihnen können es nicht mal nachvollziehen, meine Liebe
Waren früher Gang, oh, jetzt bist du nicht mehr Gang
Hatten früher Spaß, nein, jetzt hast du Scham
Nahmen früher Flüge, aber jetzt spiel' ich nicht
Wortspiel, sie liebt es, wenn ich sing'
Ich will dein Spiel nicht mehr spielen
Nein, du kannst meine Kette nicht mehr tragem
Wir sind kein Ding, kann es nicht mehr ertragen
Wartest auf deinen König, du könntest noch ein bisschen länger warten
Ja, ich erinner' mich an Tage, wo ich sie vergöttert habe
Witzig, wie dieser Scheiß sich gedreht hat wie 'ne Münze
Hol' mir 'n neues Mädchen, ich werde sie mit Fendi und Dior eindecken
Kriegt 'ne Stimmungsschwankung, ich werd' morgen weg sein (Mhh, mhh)

Rufst mich ständig an (Brrt)
Ich hab' dir schonmal gesagt, dass es zu Ende ist, lass mich in Ruhe (Ja, ja)
Weiß, dass es dich verletzt, mich gehen zu sehen
Dunkle Wolken, du wirst mich stürmen sehen
Ich werd' nicht zurückgeh'n (Ich werd' nicht zurück geh'n)
Aber vertrau mir, du wirst das halten (Das halten)
Das halten (mhh, mhh)

Dich jetzt aus meinem Kopf bekommen (Uhh, wow)
Ich bekomm' dich jetzt nicht aus meinem Kopf (Ja, ja)
Ich bekomm' dich jetzt nicht aus meinem Kopf (Meinem Kopf)

933,Beautiful Mistakes,Maroon 5,"It's beautiful, it's bittersweet
You're like a broken home to me
I take a shot of memories
And black out like an empty street
I fill my days with the way you walk
And fill my nights with broken dreams
I make up lies inside my head
Like one day you'll come back to me

Now I'm not holdin' on, not holdin' on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holdin' on, not holdin' on

Beautiful mistakes
I make inside my head
She's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake
Makin' beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'еm back
I'm in love with the past
And now we liе awake
Makin' beautiful mistakes

Nah-nah-nah, in my head
Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
Nah-nah-nah, ay
Makin' beautiful mistakes

It's pitiful, I can't believe
How every day gets worse for me
I take a break, I cut you off
To keep myself from lookin' soft
I fill my nights with the way you was
And still wake up with broken dreams
I make these lies inside my head
Feel like they're my reality

Now I'm not holdin' on, not holdin' on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holdin' on, not holdin' on

Beautiful mistakes
I make inside my head
She's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake
Makin' beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'em back
I'm in love with the past
And now we lie awake
Makin' beautiful mistakes

Nah-nah-nah, in my head
Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
Nah-nah-nah (Yeah, yeah)
Makin' beautiful mistakes

You did me wrong 'cause I let you (Let you)
Usually, I like my situations beneficial
Doin' somethin' different, got me lookin' stupid (Damn)
The only way I'm comin' back to you is if you dreamin' lucid (Hmm)
Prove it, if you made a promise then keep it (Keep it)
Why you wanna lie and then get mad? I don't believe it (Boy, bye)
But really, I was doin' just fine without ya
Lookin' fine, sippin' wine, dancin' on club couches (Ah)
Baby, why you wanna lose me like you don't need me? (Don't need me)
Like I don't block you and you still try to reach me (Still try to reach me)
How you figure out how to call me from the TV? (Huh?)
You runnin' outta chances and this time I mean it (Ah)

Yeah, bet you miss my love, all in your bed (Bed)
Now you're stressin' out, pullin' your hair (Hair)
Smellin' your pillows and wishin' I was there (I was there)
Slidin' down the shower wall, lookin' sad (Sad)
I know it's hard to let go, I'm the best (I'm the best)
Best you ever had and best you gon' get (Gon' get)
And if we break up, I don't wanna be friends (Be friends)
You're toxic

Beautiful mistakes
I make inside my head
She's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake
Makin' beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'em back
I'm in love with the past
And now we lie awake
Making' beautiful mistakes

Nah-nah-nah, in my head
Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
Nah-nah-nah, yeah, yeah (Oh)
Makin' beautiful mistakes

934,Holy,Justin Bieber,"I hear a lot about sinners
Don't think that I'll be a saint
But I might go down to the river
'Cause the way that the sky opens up when we touch
Yeah, it's makin' me say

That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy

I don't do well with the drama
And, no, I can't stand it being fake
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
I don't believe in nirvana
But the way that we love in the night gave me life
Baby, I can't explain

That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy

They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, ""Don't go crushin'""
Wise men say fools rush in
But I don't know (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, ""Don't go crushin'""
Wise men say fools rush in
But I don't know (Chance the Rapper)

The first step pleases the Father
Might be the hardest to take
But when you come out of the water
I'm a believer, my heart is fleshy
Life is short with a temper like Joe Pesci
They always come and sing your praises, your name is catchy
But they don't see you how I see you, Parlay and Desi
Cross, Tween, Tween, Hesi' hit the jet speed
When they get messy, go lefty like Lionel Messi
Let's take a trip and get the Vespas or rent a Jet Ski
I know the spots that got the best weed, we goin' next week
I wanna honor, wanna honor you, bride's groom, I'm my father's child
I know when the son takes the first steps, the Father's proud (Yes)
If you make it to the water, He'll part the clouds (Uh)
I know He made you a snack like Oscar Proud (Mwah)
Suffer it to be so now gotta clean it up (Ooh)
Formalize the union in communion, He can trust (Woo)
I know I ain't leavin' you like I know He ain't leavin' us (Ah)
I know we believe in God, and I know God believes in us

'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second, on God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second, on God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so ho-ho-ho-holy"
935,On Me,Lil Baby,"(What's happenin', Chi Chi?)

Fill the bando up with bags, give the lil' bro them a job
You can come get rich with us, you gon' eat or you gon' starve?
Keep a certified hitter sittin', I pay him not to rob
Hop out 2020 Cullinan, I'm ridin' in the stars
Know some people hate that I'm on top, I bulletproofed the car
All the members made free bands off packs, live like they crackin' cards
Joe know for a fact I keep it real, he still ain't take the charge
Why she talkin' crazy 'bout me like I don't do more than my part?
I can't play with my creation, give the world to my lil' boys
I been savin' more than I been spendin', that's what I bе on
I'm a human, I'm not perfect, I know sometimеs I be wrong

I'm like, ""Come and put that pussy on me, don't be runnin' from me""
If I like it, I spend money on it, get whatever from me
Put six figures in your business, I do real shit
I drop cash at the dealership, they'll mail you a pink slip
She make sure she keep her nails did and her wig fixed
Went to jail and that one held me down, she a real bitch
Hundred rounds in the double drum, this a Kel-Tec
Marco been in prison for a while, but he still flex

I told brodie 'nem to park the car, but they still wrecked
I don't think nobody around steal, but I still check
I don't got a hundred mil' yet, I can't chill yet
But don't get it misconstrued, yeah, I get real checks
Baby fuckin' like a pornstar, we have real sex
Have nobody in our business, we take Learjets
Say she like when I perform, so I fuck her with my chains on
And she handlin' her part, so I let her play the main role
Ain't have to get rich for these partners, still with the same folks
And I can't beef with none of you niggas, not in the same boat
I'm never gon' get caught up about it, know how the game go
Tennis chain bustin', look like rainbows

I'm like, ""Come and put that pussy on me, don't be runnin' from me""
If I like it, I spend money on it, get whatever from me
Put six figures in your business, I do real shit
I drop cash at the dealership, they'll mail you a pink slip
She make sure she keep her nails did and her wig fixed
Went to jail and that one held me down, she a real bitch
Hundred rounds in the double drum, this a Kel-Tec

I'm like, ""Come and put that pussy on me, don't be runnin' from me""

936,You Broke Me First,Tate McRae,"You broke me first, ah

Maybe you don't like talkin' too much about yourself
But you shoulda told me that you were thinkin' 'bout someone else
You're drunk at a party or maybe it's just that your car broke down
Your phone's been off for a couple months, so you're callin' me now
I know you, you're like this
When shit don't go your way, you needed me to fix it
And like me, I did
But I ran out of every reason

Now suddenly, you're askin' for it back
Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts
When you broke me first
You broke me first

Took a while, was in denial when I first heard
That you moved on quicker than I coulda ever, you know that hurt
Swear for a while, I would stare at my phone just to see your name
But now that it's there, I don't really know what to say

I know you, you're like this
When shit don't go your way, you needed me to fix it
And like me, I did
But I ran out of every reason

Now suddenly, you're askin' for it back
Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts
When you broke me first
You broke me first
What did you think would happen?
What did you think would happen?
I'll never let you have it
What did you think would happen?

Now suddenly, you're askin' for it back
Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts
When you broke me first
You broke me first (You broke me first)
You broke me first, ah"
937,Traitor,Olivia Rodrigo,"Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

Brown guilty eyes and little white lies, yeah
I played dumb, but I always knew
That you talked to her, maybe did even worse
I kept quiet so I could keep you

And ain't it funny how you ran to her
The second that we called it quits?
And ain't it funny how you said you were friends?
Now it sure as hell don't look like it

You betrayed me
And I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah
You talked to her when we were together
Loved you at your worst, but that didn't matter
It took you two weeks to go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat, but you're still a traitor

Now you bring her around just to shut me down
Show her off like she's a new trophy
And I know if you were true, there's no damn way that you
Could fall in love with somebody that quickly

And ain't it funny? All the twisted games
All the questions you used to avoid
Ain't it funny? Remember I brought her up
And you told me I was paranoid?

You betrayed me
And I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah
You talked to her when we were together
Loved you at your worst, but that didn't matter
It took you two weeks to go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat, but you're still a traitor

(Ah-ah-ah)
God, I wish that you had thought this through
Before I went and fell in love with you
(Ah-ah-ah)
When she's sleepin' in the bed we made
Don't you dare forget about the way

You betrayed me
'Cause I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah
You talked to her when we were together
You gave me your word, but that didn't matter
It took you two weeks to go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat, but you're still, you're still a traitor

Yeah, you're still a traitor

I hope you're both feelin' sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night

Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans

I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats

And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me

Yeah, babe, I hope she shows up in a 2 AM pic from her friend
Hanging on to a guy and you just ain't him
I hope you stay up all night all alone, waitin' by the phone
And then she calls
And baby, I, I hope you work it out
Forgive and just about forget
And take her on a first date again
And when you lean in for a kiss

I hope you're both feelin' sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free

Yeah, I kinda put the cup down for a minute but umm
But honestly, it ain't nobody's business what's in my cup, what's in your cup, what's in they cup
It's your cup, drink it
So whatever the hell was in my cup, the only reaction I did was got more popular, more successful
Than a lot more things that I've ever done, I probably should pick that cup back up (Haha)

I'm sittin' here lookin' at Keisha, like, ""Do you love me, do you love me not?""
Damn, you hit the spot
Taste like candy (Candy), sweet like fruit (Ooh)
Wet like water, can I love on you?
Withdrawals, I'm feelin' different, every day I need a dose
Every now and thеn I'm missin', I got my times when I go ghost
But she minе (Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm), I'm stampin' her
Priority status, so them other bitches mad at her (Too mad, ha)
Thumbin' through a hunnid thou', I spent that times two on you
Caught myself cuttin' you loose, then I pop back up like peekaboo
Here I go, flyer than most, Louis V coat
Gas station, coffee cup full, I don't drive boats, no
Money can't buy happiness but she found love inside a G
Head and somethin' to eat, that's all a thug nigga need
No lie you get me higher than the prices on my weed
I'm displayin' my feelings like I'm wearing 'em on my sleeve (See)

One minute I'm done with you, the next one I be runnin' back
Go your way, I go my way but somehow we be still attached
Tryna find my answers with this cup, but ain't no truth in that
They be like, I'm dumb for fuckin' with you, I spend stupid racks

I'm sittin' here knowing I don't need ya pouring O's in the liter
Sippin' chaser with my reefer, can't get my mind off Wockesha
Watch me put my heart in this cup
In my feelings, she my therapist, I'ma talk to this cup (I swear)

Ring around the rose-z, cup full of OZ's
I hope I don't OD, she keep sayin', ""Pour me""
Turn me to that purple demon emoji (Devil)
Fuck me like you miss me, it's been a whole week
This ain't no playground love, we grown (Too grown)
I'm too fucked up, I paid four hunnid for a zone (That strong)
My bitch don't like you, you've been fuckin' up my home (In my house)
Relapsin' every time I try to leave you 'lone (I relapse, girl)
Every nigga in the street lookin' for her but she rare
Dark skin, purple hair, stingy, with her hard to share (I can't)
Never needed nobody but it feel good to have somebody (That somebody)
Drop you and pick you up whenever I feel like it
This shit toxic
Let me know if you feel me, hmm-hmm (Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm, hmm)
I gotta stop it, I must stop it

One minute I'm done with you, the next one I be runnin' back
Go your way, I go my way but somehow we be still attached
Tryna find my answers with this cup, but ain't no truth in that
They be like, I'm dumb for fuckin' with you, I spend stupid racks

I'm sittin' here knowing I don't need ya pouring O's in the liter
Sippin' chaser with my reefer, can't get my mind off Wockesha
Watch me put my heart in this cup
In my feelings, she my therapist, I'ma talk to this cup (I swear)

Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm"

Bir adamım var ama seni istiyorum
Bir adamım var ama seni istiyorum
Ve sadece cüret, sadece alet
Beni başka biri hakkında düşündürtüyor
Biliyorsun söyleyeceğim çok şey var
Yüzümde saklamaya çalışıyorum
Ama işe yaramıyor, yüzümden okuyabiliyorsun
Sadece senle olmak istediğimi
Ve sen haklısın

Sen haklısın, erkeğimi aldım
Ama engel olamıyorum, seni istiyorum
Dedim ki haklısın, erkeğimi aldım
Ama ben, engel olamıyorum, seni istiyorum

Durup başka yere bakamıyorum
Çünkü biliyorum olabilir, bebeğim, ve sеn aynısını hissetmeyebilirsin
Onun hakkında hеr gün hakkında düşünüyorsun
Peri masallarına inanmıyorsun, ama bizim de fantezilerimiz var
Ve sadece ben ve sen, o yok
Çarşaflarına serilmek istiyorum
Üstümün her yerindesin
O kadar da derin değilmiş gibi davranıyorsun
Oğlum, sinirini benden çıkarabilirsin
Ne olmak üzere, söyle bana
Olmak zorundaymış gibi hissediyorum
Kimseye söyleyemem ama herkes biliyor

Bir adamım var ama seni istiyorum
Bir adamım var ama seni istiyorum
Ve sadece cüret, sadece alet
Beni başka biri hakkında düşündürtüyor
Biliyorsun söyleyeceğim çok şey var
Yüzümde saklamaya çalışıyorum
Ama işe yaramıyor, yüzümden okuyabiliyorsun
Sadece senle olmak istediğimi
Ve sen haklısın

Sen haklısın, erkeğimi aldım
Ama engel olamıyorum, seni istiyorum
Dedim ki haklısın, erkeğimi aldım
Ama ben, engel olamıyorum, seni istiyorum

Kızım, ben de seni beni istediğin gibi istiyorum
O enerjiyi hissediyorum (Oh, evet) sen benim üstümdeyken (Oh, evet)
Senin adamını biliyorum, seni kontrol etmiyor
Ama hala tereddüt ediyorsun (Oh) çünkü sadakati seçtin (Oh, evet)
Ama senin hikayeni biliyorum (Hey), senin zirvenden önce onla tanıştım (Hey)
Senin eskiden olduğun kadına çok bağlı
Ama-Ama-Ama seks hafızanı bulandırmış
Birkaç okşayış, onu içine koyacağım, sonra bana ait olacaksın

Bir adamım var ama seni istiyorum
Bir adamım var ama seni istiyorum
Ve sadece cüret, sadece alet
Beni başka biri hakkında düşündürtüyor
Biliyorsun söyleyeceğim çok şey var
Yüzümde saklamaya çalışıyorum
Ama işe yaramıyor, yüzümden okuyabiliyorsun
Sadece senle olmak istediğimi (Evet, evet, evet, evet)

Ve sen haklısın (Evet)
Sen haklısın, erkeğimi aldım (erkeğimi)

943,Beat Box 2,SpotemGottem & SpotemGottem,"49 ContributorsBeat Box 2 Lyrics
Let go
(Damn E, this shit exclusive) Stretch gang
Face shots to the face, don't trip on yo' lace
Mafia

Bur— Bur— Burn away a carbon beam, knock your legs off
Tried to get away from me, had a standoff
Hit him in the spine, knock his dreads off
My woadie just caught a body, I nicknamed him Randy Moss
Thuggin' in my Reeboks, ridin' with a G-SHOCK
Shh, I heard he shot, Draco make 'em beat box
OG made that sharp turn, woadie spot 'em, peeled the car
Had a mask on, Draco make 'em beat box

In Miami with my motherfuckin' heat out
With another nigga bitch, said she got her feet out
I walked in the party, I'm on my big goon shit
Ready to get it started, bitch, I got no sensе
Oh, he the plug, ridin' 'round with four bricks
Call me Kobе, twenty-four on me
Can't fuck wit' her no more, that lil' bitch, she do the most
I get my groove on every time I see them folks
I got the antidote, I'm thinking that's something you need to know
I'm smooth and I'm cold, she know my wrist on froze
Skinny jeans on with a big bankroll
She playin' my song, I got her takin' off her thong
I'm tryna get it on, she feeling all over my Peter bone
Two rights don't make a wrong, it just go on and on
I'm kickin' shit like Jackie Chan 'til they got my kicks on
I aim, I hit my target, I'ma up this bitch regardless

Bur— Bur— Burn away a carbon beam, knock your legs off
Tried to get away from me, had a standoff
Hit him in the spine, knock his dreads off
My woadie just caught a body, I nicknamed him Randy Moss
Th— Th— Thuggin' in my Reeboks, riding with a G-SHOCK
Shh, I heard he shot, Draco make 'em beat box
OG made that sharp turn, woadie spot 'em, peeled the car
Had a mask on, Draco make 'em beat box (Blrrrd-blrrrd)

I'm strapped up wit' this jug, one in the head, already de-cocked (It's de-cocked)
I pop out when the beef hot, won't see me creepin' on your block (Nope, nope)
I work the back seat, we went three deep and got ten people shot (Blrrrd, blrrrd)
I hit the auto-switch and made it twerk and while he dumped the Glock (Blrrrd, blrrrd)
Got the drop on all his spot, he gettin' robbed if he go or not
I know the taste and love Wock', he pourin' up in exotic pop
That booster hitter tried to pull a move and that shit got him dropped
Blrrrd, blrrrd-blrrrd, you pussies know what's up
Turn a nigga to a pack, we break 'em down and roll 'em up
Ain't shit changed but the whip, now it's a Rolls truck when I'm pulling up
And I still ain't check the time up on my Cartier, just hold it up (Blrrrd)
Don't come around acting gangster, we call your bluff (Blrrrd-blrrrd)
Put trust in these firearms, know we dangerous
If you catch me speed up, bitch, give it up or I'ma buss
We shoot your shit up on the E-Way, get out the same lane as us
Blrrrd, blrrrd-blrrrd (Same lane as us), Big Blrrrd

Bur— Bur— Burn away a carbon beam (Blrrrd), knock your legs off (Legs off)
Tried to get away from me (Yeah), had a standoff (Blrrrd-blrrrd)
Hit him in the spine, knock his dreads off (Blrrrd)
My woadie just caught a body, I nicknamed him Randy Moss
Th— Th— Thuggin' in my Reeboks, riding with a G-SHOCK
Shh, I heard he shot, Draco make 'em beat box
OG made that sharp turn, woadie spot 'em, peeled the car
Had a mask on, Draco make 'em beat box"
944,Laugh Now Cry Later,Drake,"Woah, woah
Yeah

Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

Tired of beefin' you bums, you can't even pay me enough to react
Been wakin' up in the crib and sometimes I don't even know where I'm at
Please don't play that nigga songs in this party, I can't even listen to that
Anytime that I ran into somebody, it must be a victory lap, ayy
Shawty, come sit on my lap, ayy, they sayin' Drizzy just snap
Distance between us is not like a store, this isn't a closeable gap, ayy
I've seen some niggas attack and don't end up makin' it back

I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

I'm in the trenches, relax
Can you not play that lil' boy in the club? 'Cause we do not listen to rats
We in Atlanta, I buy her a wig, she tellin' me Tae is the best
Point at the nigga who act like a killer, but you only one from the 'net
I'm like DaBaby, I'm not just a rapper, you play with me, you gon' get stretched
Ooh-oh
Bring Drake to the hood, surround Drake around Dracs
Even though I got a case, I'ma do what it take
And I never been embraced
And the money's hard to make
So I bet they on they face right now

I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

When he tell the story, that's not how it went
Know they be lyin', a hundred percent
Moved out the Ritz and forgot 'bout the Bent'
Valet just called me to tell me come get it
Knocked that boy off and I don't want no credit
If it was me, they wouldn't regret it
Left me for dead and now they wan' dead it, yeah
Heart is still beatin', my niggas still eatin'
Backyard, it look like the Garden of Eden
Pillow talk with 'em, she spillin' the tea
And then shawty came back and said she didn't mean it
It's hard to believe it

I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?"

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

Leave me out the comments, leave me out the nonsense
Speakin' out of context, people need some content
Niggas tryna keep up, shit is not a contest
Whippin' Benz concept
Heaven-sent, God-sent
Least that's what my mom says
Proof is in the progress, money's not a object
Busy than a motherfucker, you know how my job get
Barkin' up the wrong tree, you know how the dogs get
Haven't fallen off yet, yee
Come with a classic, they come around years later and say it's a sleeper
The earrings are real, the petty is real, might charge my ex for a feature
Deposit the money to Brenda, LaTisha, or Linda, Felicia
She came for me twice, I didn't even nut for her once, you know I'm a pleaser
Forty-two millimeter, was made in Geneva
Yeah, I probably should go to Yeshiva, we went to Ibiza
Yeah, I probably should go link with Yeezy, I need me some Jesus
But soon as I started confessin' my sins, he wouldn't believe us

Sins, I got sins on my mind
And some M's, got a lot of M's on my mind
And my friends, yeah, I keep my friends on my mind
I'm in love, I'm in love with two girls at one time
And they tens, that's why I got ten on my mind
I got M's, got a lot of M's on my mind
And my friends, yeah, I keep my friends on my mind
Should repent, I need me some Jesus in my life
Amen

I'm from the four, but I love me a threesome
DM her, delete it, she my lil' secret
He tryna diss me to blow up, I peep it
I can't respond, we just go at your people
If I left some racks on the bed, you can keep it
This shit gettin' deeper and deeper, I dig it
My shovel wasn't bent, I was broke, had to fix it
A shark in the water, you swim with the lil' fishes
I hit today, by tomorrow, she miss it
I grab her neck, she look up, then I kiss it
I'm not a GOAT, but I fit the description
I like to pour, so I get the prescription
We walk around with them bands in our britches
This gun ain't gon' jam, when I blow, I ain't missin'
I'm droppin' hit after hit, I'm just chillin'
But I'll send a hit while I chill with my children
Bigger the business, the bigger the office
I fucked 'round and found me a swag, then I caught up
They call for my artists, they makin' me offers
I don't even bargain, I'll start from the bottom
I lost a Ferrari, Las Vegas, Nevada
I woke up the followin' day and went harder
I'm crackin' my shell now, they see that I'm smarter
I gotta get money, I love to get charter
I gave her four Birkins and one's for her daughter (Skrrt)
I can't let 'em down, walk around with my guard up
I'm screamin' out ""YOLO,"" yeah, that's still the motto
I know I be on some shit that they ain't thought of

Sins, I got sins on my mind
And some M's, got a lot of M's on my mind
And my friends, yeah, I keep my friends on my mind
I'm in love, I'm in love with two girls at one time
And they tens, that's why I got ten on my mind

You know I'm just a flight away
If you want it, you could take a private plane
A kilómetros estamos conectando
Y me prendes aunque no me estés tocando
You know I got a lot to say
All these voices in the background of my brain
Y me dicen todo lo que estás pensando
Me imagino lo que ya estás maquinando

Quién lo diría que se podría
Hacer el amor por telepatía
La luna está llena, mi cama vacía
Lo que yo te haría
Si te tuviera de frente, la mente te la volaría
De noche y de día, de noche y de día

You know that I can see right through you
I can read your mind, I can read your mind
What you wanna do?
It's written all over your face, times two
'Cause I can read your mind, I can read your mind
I can hear your thoughts like a melody
Listen while you talk when you're fast asleep
You stay on the phone just to hear me breathe

951,Good Days,SZA,"Good day in my mind, safe to take a step out
Get some air now, let yo' edge out
Too soon, I spoke
You be heavy in my mind, can you get the heck out?
I need rest now, got me bummed out
You so, you so, you
Baby, baby, babe
I've been on my empty mind shit

I try to keep from losin' the rest of me
I worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe
You don't care
Said, ""Not tryna be a nuisance, this is urgent""
Tryna make sense of loose change
Got me a war in my mind
Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holdin' me
Choose to watch while the world break up in front of me

All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile
Still wanna try, still believe in
Good days, good days, always
Always inside (Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind)
Good day living in my mind

Tell me I'm not my fears, my limitations
I disappear if you let me
Feelin' like, yeah (On your own)
Feelin' like Jericho
Feelin' like Job when he lost his shit
Gotta hold my own, my cross to bear alone, I
Ooh, played and dipped, way to kill the mood
Know you like that shit
Can't groove it, ba-baby
Heavy on my empty mind shit

I gotta keep from losin' the rest of me (Rest of me)
Still worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe
You don't care
Said, ""Not tryna be a nuisance, this is urgent"" (It's urgent)

All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile
Still wanna try, still believe in
Good days, good days, always (Good days on my mind, good days on my mind)
Sunny inside (Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind)
Good day living in my mind

Gotta get right
Tryna free my mind before the end of the world
I don't miss no ex, I don't miss no text
I choose not to respond
I don't regret, just pretend shit never happened
Half of us layin' waste to our youth, it's in the present
(Na-na, na-na, na-na, na)
Half of us chasin' fountains of youth and it's in the present now

Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind
You've been making me feel like I'm
Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind"
952,Starting Over,Chris Stapleton,"16 ContributorsStarting Over Lyrics
Well, the road rolls out like a welcome mat
To a better place than the one we're at
And I ain't got no kinda plan
But I've had all of this town I can stand

And I got friends out on the coast
We can jump in the water and see what floats
We've been savin' for a rainy day
Let's beat the storm and be on our way

And it don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And, honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice

I can be your lucky penny
You can be my four-leaf clover
Startin' over

This might not be an easy time
There's rivers to cross and hills to climb
Some days, we might fall apart
And some nights might feel cold and dark

But nobody wins afraid of losin'
And the hard roads are the ones worth choosin'
Someday, we'll look back and smile
And know it was worth every mile

And it don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And, honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice

I can be your lucky penny
You can be my four-leaf clover
Startin' over
Startin' over


It don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And, honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice

I can be your lucky penny
You can be my four-leaf clover
Startin' over
Startin' over

954,Willow,Taylor Swift,"I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a '90s trend

Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open-shut case
I guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Hey, that's my man
That's my man
Yeah, that's my man
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
That's my man
Hey, that's my man
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man"

I'm way too old to try so whatever

956,Better Together,Luke Combs,"23 ContributorsBetter Together Lyrics
A 40 HP Johnson on a flat bottom metal boat
Coke cans and BB guns, barbed wire and old fence posts
8-point bucks in autumn and freshly cut cornfields
One arm out the window and one hand on the wheel

Some things just go better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here

Your license in my wallet when we go out downtown
Your lipstick's stained every coffee cup that I got in this house
The way you say, ""I love you, too"" is like rain on an old tin roof
And your hand fits right into mine like a needle in a groove

Some things just go better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here

Sometimes we're oil and water
But I wouldn't have it any other way
And if I'm being honest
Your first and my last name

Would just sound better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here
And me, as long as you're right here"

So you wanna be riding around with your new bitch
That's real cute
Don't have me drag you and her out that motherfuckin' car
Key your shit
Ha! I wish I would see you in that Bentley
So I could flat all four of your motherfuckin' tires
And you know what? I just got tickets to the Lakers game anyway
Nigga, you could never

If I ever made you angry, girl
Just know that it get better with time (Time)
They say time heals
She can't see her life without me, she's so blind still
Fuck that nigga, you can tell him that you're mines still

And she don't wanna go to sleep, she angry
Lately, she's been noticing hе ain't me

I wish that we can change placеs
Don't want no new, new faces
She got my heartbeat racing
They say time heals
Don't go build no life without me 'cause you're mines still
Oh, and I don't wanna go unless you make me
Lately I've been gone, I'm feeling crazy

Yeah, I'm from the bricks, we gotta whole lot of bricks
You gotta whole lotta tricks and I wanna see what you do with them
I just saw you in Miami, girl, what you doing here?
I hope you with your girlfriends
I ain't pay attention to your heart, I played ya
Now she fell in love with an NBA player
Had her on the stage, now she ballin at the stadium
Matter fact I hope you stay with him
'Cause I don't wanna go unless you take me
I know you feel the pain

And she don't wanna go to sleep, she angry
Lately, she's been noticing he ain't me

I wish that we can change places
Don't want no new, new faces
She got my heartbeat racing
They say time heals
Don't go build no life without me 'cause you're mine still
And I don't wanna go unless you make me
Down on my knees hoping you take me

Better tell that nigga you mine
Heard you've been trying to tie the knot, girl, tell me you lyin'
Let me beat that pussy up one more time
Let me beat that pussy up one more time
I know that you fiend for this
I know that you did not forget
So don't go to sleep

And she don't wanna go to sleep, she angry
Lately, she been noticing he ain't me

DJ Khaled

Scratched a million off my checklist three years ago
Add two zeros to the one, I'm in a different mode
This my life, do what I want, I be with different hoes
You know the pick and roll, I picked her up and sent her home
I got rich off strong, we get ’em in and get 'em gone
You know Trappy just got out, I ain't have to put him on
We the ones who got the numbers, who put the city on
It’s the middle of the summer, I got a hoodie on
My demon time ain't nothin' nice
I try not to wear nothin' twice
I came up off of shootin' dice, yeah
My lil' brother ain't livin' right
My sis’ and ’em doin' aight
My cuz and ’em still servin' life, yeah
Seen a robber rob a deacon
I seen a preacher get caught for cheatin'
I'll break the bank for one of my people
I said, ""I’m the one,"" they didn't believe me
I show 'em the facts, now they all need me
I'ma get cake as long as I'm breathin'
They makin' it hard, this shit really easy, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

I'ma turn up on a hater every chance that I get
I want the biggest watch that they got, don't care if that shit hurt my wrist
All these hoes fuck on us all, I wish I would claim that bitch
They get hard when they get guns, we got a hood full of sticks
Soon as they say we can't come, you know we'll run 'round that bitch
You can miss me with that shit, you know I live in the mix (Money, cars and clothes and hoes)
You know I live in the mix (Money, cars and clothes and hoes)

Yeah, she think I'm a regular rapper, I'm not
One person come tell me we fuckin', you blocked
Watch me run this shit to the tippity-top, yeah (Keep goin')
Put my kids in Givenchy
She must think one plus one is three
I can't support your personal needs
She don't got a mortgage, moved in with her niece
These niggas be cappin', them cars be leased
Youngest in charge, I speak for the streets
I was nodding off, they woke up a beast
Struggle what made me, we used to have water for dinner, we didn't have nothin' to eat
Soon as I get on his ass, they gon' look at me better, like, ""Damn, he was fuckin' with me,"" yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

I'ma turn up on a hater every chance that I get
I want the biggest watch that they got, don't care if that shit hurt my wrist

You know I live in the mix (Money, cars and clothes and hoes)

I'm from the trenches
Niggas be tough on the 'net, but really be there for attention
Well, bitches be talkin' like they really rich, but really be beggin' me under my pictures
I'll give her forty, fifty thousand cash to start up a business
I'll spend that shit at the dentist
I'd rather fuck her and pay up her rent for a year just to get out of her feelings
I'm in the Lambo' truck in my hood, nobody gon' tell me shit
Goin' to Cali, I pick up my weed for sure, nobody gon' mail me shit
Dice game, Craps and Cee-Lo, I need cash, don't sell me shit
Baby got his hood on smash, yeah, you can tell they really rich
Drop the lo', ain't no room right now, I took her to the O
Then I pulled up on the Lam' 'cause she a fan of Boonie Moe
I got the city on lock, uh, fuckin' up all the opps
I be around with three million dollars in jewelry, I'm standin' on all the blocks
This the anthem, mmm-hmm
Droppin' the six in the Fanta, mmm
Black Rolls truck with the all-white seats, remind me of sittin' on panda, mmm
I love my cousin, she was a dancer
I love my brother, he was a scammer
Sittin' on my lap 'cause I'm pullin' her tracks and I fuck from the back 'cause she callin' me handsome (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

You come over when your wine's all gone
Always catch me when I'm not that strong
Then you wind up staying all night long
Ain't nothin' new
Then I wake up with you on my chest
You got a way of making me forget
Girl, with you the answer's always yes
Every time you call

But I know, yeah I know it's a matter of time
'Till you walk, 'till you walk back out of my life
Leave me standing here lonely feeling like a fool
Every time, every time you say we're done
You come back to the love you werе running from
Don't know why, don't know why I let you but I do
Guess I love chasing aftеr you

Listen
Wish I could quit you but it feels too good
If I could turn it off, you know I would
But somethin' 'bout you makes me think we could
Make it after all

But I know, yeah I know it's a matter of time
'Till you walk, 'till you walk back out of my life
Leave me standing here lonely feeling like a fool
Every time, every time you say we're done
You come back to the love you were running from
Don't know why, don't know why I let you but I do
Guess I love chasing after you

You come over when your wine's all gone
Always catch me when I'm not that strong
Then you wind up staying all night long

Belki büyüdüğümde, hepsi diner

They wanna know how I'm livin' my day-to-day life in the regular season

And Valentine's Day, I had sex, okay?

The liquor been takin' the pain away
I heard you was givin' your chain away
That's kinda like givin' your fame away

A boss is a role that I've grown into
I love you to death but I told you the truth

My buddy Brandon holds the record
For single-season touchdown throws
And good ol' Johnny, he's the life of every party
It's like Cheers, they know him everywhere he goes

I've got some famous friends you've probably never heard of
But back in Rutherford County, our crowd is second to none
You might not know 'em here in this big city we're in
But when I go back home, I've got some famous friends
Yeah, I do

My buddy Jason, he's the sheriff
He'll flash his lights, but lеt me go
My boy Randy, he's a preachеr
My girl Megan, she's been teacher of the year
I swear for five years in a row

I've got some famous friends you've probably never heard of
But back in Hamilton County, our crowd is second to none
You might not know 'em here in this big city we're in
But when I go back home, I've got some famous friends
Yeah, I do

I got friends in high places, on these small town roads
'Cause 'round here, it's all about the people that you know

And I've got some famous friends you've probably never heard of

Order '42 for the table, let’s pop shit
Missionary or doggystyle, I'ma top shit
Pussy-ass niggas hatin' on me from the closet, ah
Hoes tryna call me a snake, shit, I guess I can relate
'Cause a bitch spit a whole lotta venom
And since these hoes all rats, when they come around me
All I see is a whole lotta dinner
I walk around the house butt-naked
And I stop at every mirror just to stare at my own posterior
I don't give a fuck who talk behind my back
'Cause the bitch knew better than to let me hear her (Ah)

Ninety-nine percent tint in a blacked-out Wraith
I remember hoes used to clap for me happily
Now I'm bossed up and them same hoes mad at me
Acting like they ridin', whole time tryna pass me
Watchin' me go through it and still tryna drag me
Actin' like you winnin', if you think about it, actually

And none of these hoes finna see me at the bank
And I'ma keep talkin' all the shit that I want

Disobey me, then baby, it's off with your head
Gonna change it and make it a world you won't forget (Oh)

'Cause I just want you here tonight (Ooh)
Holding on to me so tight (Ooh)
What more can I do?
Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

Oh, all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere (So brightly, baby)
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air (Oh, oh yeah)
And everyone is singing (Oh yeah)
I hear those sleigh bells ringing (Oh)
Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need? (Yeah, oh, oh)
Won't you please bring my baby to me?

Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for (Ah)
I just wanna see my baby
Standing right outside my door

Oh, I just want you for my own (Ooh)
More than you could ever know (Ooh)
Make my wish come true

Did you grow up on a tractor?
Did your daddy let you drive?
Are you whiskey bent and hell bound?
Even though your mama tried
Did you cruise down a backroad
With your Dixieland Delight?
Are you on the Chattahoochee
On a barefoot blue jean night?

Everybody got a small town anthem
Everybody got a story to tell
Everybody got a hallelujah
Everybody been through a little hell
When you're rolling down a two-lane highway
And you turn your radio on
Tell me which one hits you, baby
Yeah, what's your country song?
Yeah, what's your country song?

Do your exes live in Texas?
Are you so lonesome you could cry?
Are you heart-broke 'cause you know
That ain't your truck in her drive?
Are your friends all in low places
Underneath the neon moon?
Were you already country
Back when country wasn't cool?

Everybody got a small town anthem
Everybody got a story to tell
Everybody got a hallelujah
Everybody been through a little hell
When you're rolling down a two-lane highway
And you turn your radio on
Tell me which one hits you, baby
Yeah, what's your country song?
Yeah, what's your country song?

Who's your strawberry wine?
What's your family tradition?
What makes you turn it up?
Makes you raise your cup every time you listen?

Everybody got a small town anthem
Everybody got a story to tell
Everybody got a hallelujah
Everybody been through a little hell
When you're rolling down a two-lane highway
And you turn your radio on
Tell me which one hits you, baby
Yeah, what's your country song?

Yeah, yeah

I don't remember much about last night
Woke up on a couch sun-rise
Saw the living room
Through these bloodshot eyes of mine, cold sober
You didn’t like that I came home late
4 AM but it's a Friday, babe
And I've been working hard
Can't you give me some space 'stead of shouting out, ""Oh my God""?

Oh-oh, ooh-yeah
Oh-oh, ooh-yeah
I go out with some new friends
But it just makes me miss you more, more

I spend all my money drinking on my own, yeah
In this bar, just sat here staring at my phone
And I keep second guessing, where did I go wrong?
I know I'm proud
But I've had one too many
Come take me home

So now I'm the one that's crying
I didn't wanna call 'cause I didn't wanna fight
I swear that I was trying, yeah
But everybody falls when their head's a little high
And I've never meant to get so out my mind
With you playing cool, just pretending it's fine
Oh, we've been 'round, 'round, 'round this
Too many times before

Oh-oh, ooh yeah
Oh-oh, ooh yeah
I go out with some new friends
But it just makes me miss you more, more

I spend all my money drinking on my own, yeah
In this bar, just sat here staring at my phone
And I keep second guessing, where did I go wrong?
I know I'm proud
But I've had one too many
Come take me home

I don't know how lucky, how lucky I am, I am, I am, no
I guess sometimes I should give more of a damn, a damn, a damn about you
I don't know how lucky, how lucky I am, I am, I am, no
I know we're both stubborn
Push each other's buttons
I'd rather do it with you, but...
I spend all my money drinking on my own, yeah
In this bar, just sat here staring at my phone

I spend all my money drinking on my own, yeah
In this bar, just sat here staring at my phone
And I keep second guessing, where did I go wrong?
I know I'm proud
But I've had one too many, come take me home

Come take me home
Yeah, I've had one too many"

I'm still fixing all the cracks
Lost a couple of pieces when
I carried it, carried it, carried it home
I'm afraid of all I am
My mind feels like a foreign land
Silence ringing inside my head
Please, carry me, carry me, carry me home

I've spent all of the love I saved
We were always a losing game
Small-town boy in a big arcade
I got addicted to a losing game

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game

How many pennies in the slot?
Giving us up didn't take a lot
I saw the end 'fore it begun
Still I carried, I carried, I carry on

We just tryna catch a good time
Even if it takes all night
Pass that bottle 'round the campfire
Sippin' apple pie moonshine
Yeah, we pickin' on them guitars just right
Everybody singin' ""Dixieland Delight""
Like a bobber on a wet line
We just tryna catch a good time

Eighty degrees and the sun ain't even out
We got a spot a couple miles outta town
When that moon comes up, you know what's goin' down
We got them foldin' chairs leanin' way back
No other plans other than relax
We ain't worried 'bout tomorrow from where we at

We just tryna catch a good time
Even if it takes all night
Pass that bottle 'round the campfire
Sippin' apple pie moonshine
Yeah, we pickin' on them guitars just right
Everybody singing ""Dixieland Delight""
Like a bobber on a wet line
We just tryna catch a good time

Way down here, we all got that Southern drawl
Take our time when we talkin', ""Hey Y'all""
Yeah, it don't take much for us to have it all (That's right)
Something 'bout a night this clear
Makes your problems disappear
We just gonna stay right here and let the world go by

We just tryna catch a good time
Even if it takes all night
Pass that bottle 'round the campfire
Sippin' apple pie moonshine
Yeah, we pickin' on them guitars just right
Everybody singing ""Dixieland Delight""
Like a bobber on a wet line
We just tryna catch a good time

Something 'bout a night this clear
Makes your problems disappear
So we just gonna stay right here and let the world go by

We just tryna catch a good time
Even if it takes all night, al night
Pass that bottle 'round the campfire
Sippin' apple pie moonshine, sippin' apple pie moonshine
Yeah, we pickin' on them guitars just right
Everybody singing ""Dixieland Delight""

We just tryna catch a good time

Tryna catch a good time (Good time)

I wouldn't mind bein' alone
I wouldn't keep checkin' my phone
Wouldn't take the long way home
Just to drive myself crazy
I wouldn't be losin' sleep
Rememberin' everything
Everything you said to me
Like I'm doin' lately

You, you wouldn't be all
All that I want
Baby, I could let go

If I didn't love you I'd be good by now
I'd be better than barely gettin' by somehow
Yeah, it would be easy not to miss you
Wonder about who's with you
Turn the want you off whenever I want to
If I didn't love you
If I didn't love you

I wouldn't still cry sometimes
Wouldn't have to fake a smile
Play it off and tell a lie
When somebody asked how I've been
I'd try to find someone new (Someone new)
It should be somethin' I can do (I can do)
Baby, if it weren't for you

Wonder about who's with you
Turn the want you off whenever I want to

I'm good at rollin' dice, no good at standin' still
You liked the thought of chasin' life instead of dollar bills
We were livin' reckless, nothin' to catch us, baby

This town's our canvas, baby, let's paint it red tonight
Go out like shootin' stars, chasin' what's in our hearts
Into thе blue (Into the blue)

991,Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree,Brenda Lee,"44 ContributorsRockin’ Around the Christmas Tree Lyrics
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Every couple tries to stop
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later, we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling

You will get a sentimental feeling
When you hear
Voices singing, ""Let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly""

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancin' merrily
In the new old-fashioned way


You will get a sentimental feeling
When you hear
Voices singing, ""Let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly""

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancin' merrily
In the new old-fashioned way"
992,Put Your Records On,Ritt Momney,"Three little birds sat on my window
And they told me I don't need to worry
Summer came like cinnamon, so sweet
Little girls double-dutch on the concrete

Maybe sometimes we got it wrong, but it's all right
The more things seem to change, the more they stay the same
Don't you hesitate

Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down

You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow

Blue as the sky, sunburnt and lonely
Sipping tea in the bar by the roadside (Just relax, just relax)
Don't you let those other boys fool you
Gotta love that afro hairdo

Maybe sometimes we feel afraid, but it's all right
The more you stay the same, the more that they seem to change
Don't ya think it's strange?

Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down

You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow

Just more than I could take, pity for pity's sake
Some nights kept me awake, I thought that I was stronger
When you gonna realize that you don't even have to try any longer?
Do what you want to

Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song
Just go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down
You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow"
993,Happier Than Ever,Billie Eilish,"When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true

Give me a day or two to think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to (When I asked you to)
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (What you said you'd do)
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly werеn't aware that you made me misеrable
So if you really wanna know

When I'm away from you (When I'm away from you)
I'm happier than ever (Happier than ever)
Wish I could explain it better (Wish I could explain it better)
I wish it wasn't true, mm-mm

You call me again, drunk in your Benz
Drivin' home under the influence
You scared me to death, but I'm wastin' my breath
'Cause you only listen to your fuckin' friends
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city

And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fuckin' sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid

You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just fuckin' leave me alone, yeah (Fuck you)
(Ah)
(Goddamn)
(Ah)
(Fuck you)
(Fuck you)"

I was out taking shots
Throwing down at the spot
Three sheets, just me and the guys
Every single Saturday night
I was killing time, crushing cans
Trying not to catch a tan
'Cause I was under them neon lights
Every single Saturday night, yeah
Everybody knew they could find me there
And right out of the blue, right out of nowhere
Out of nowhere

Sittin’ over in the corner, baby, I saw
Pretty red lips, working on a White Claw
Shakin' to a little “Shook Me All Night Long”
And I thought, ""Man, what a beautiful sight""
Ain't a mornin’ you don't wake up in my shirt now
Even holding hands walkin' out of church now
Who'd of thought, baby, looking back that
That would be my last single Saturday night?
Yeah
My last single Saturday night

And now when I'm out, havin' a drink or two
If they see me, huh, they see you
'Cause, girl, I got you by my side
Every single Saturday night, yeah
Every now and then, the boys tell me they miss me
Oh but they all get it 'cause they were right there with me
Yeah with me, when

Sittin’ over in the corner, baby, I saw
Pretty red lips, working on a White Claw
Shakin’ to a little, “Shook Me All Night Long”
And I thought, ""Man, what a beautiful sight""
Ain't a morning you don’t wake up in my shirt now
Even holding hands walkin' out of church now
Who'd of thought, baby, looking back that
That would be my last single Saturday night?

The last time that I'd buy a drink for a girl I’d never met before
I wasn't looking for love when I walked through the door
But damn if I didn't find what I wasn't even looking for


Sittin' over in the corner, baby, I saw
Pretty red lips, working on a White Claw
Shakin' to a little “Shook Me All Night Long”
And I thought, ""Man, what a beautiful sight""
Ain't a morning you don't wake up in my shirt now
Look at us even pickin' out a church now
Who'd of thought, baby, looking back that
That would be my last single Saturday night?
Yeah
My last single Saturday night"

Who gave up and got it wrong
If you really love a woman, you don't let her go
Yeah, I know a few things a man oughta know

If I can't have it, I can do without
I can hang a picture same as I can take it down
And how to keep it hidden when a heart gets broke
Yeah, I know a few things a man oughta know

How to know when it's love
How to stay when it's tough
How to know you're messin' up a good thing
And how to fix it 'fore it's too late

Well, I know a few things a man oughta know

Big Dipper hanging high up there
Breathe in the Backwoods and let it go

I ain't ever been the church goin' type
Can't quote much past 3:16
Even though it's a Friday night
Church found me

Sittin' here, drinkin' beer, talkin' God, amen
Killin' time, livin' life with some downhome friends
When the world's gone crazy, man, it all makes sense
Sittin' here, drinkin' beer, talkin' God, amen, amen

Tell em' boys
Yeah, baby

Gotta thank him for a little piece of dirt
Little peace of mind from a cold one
Got a country angel I don't deserve
The kind that you never let go of

I don't know what Heaven looks like
No, I don't think anybody does
If it's like down here up there tonight
And there's folks like us

Sittin' here, drinkin' beer, talkin' God, Amen (Talkin' God, amen)

So we never think about you and me
But today, I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road

You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new

Pass auf dich auf

Ich wache auf zu den Klängen der Stille, die
Meinen Gedanken erlaubt, herumzuschweifen, mit meinem Ohr auf dem Boden
Ich suche, um die Geschichten zu sehen, die erzählt werden
Wenn ich der Welt meinen Rücken zugekehrt habe, die lächelte, als ich mich umdrehte

Sagеn dir, du seist der Größte
Abеr sobald du dich umdrehst, hassen sie uns

Oh, welch ein Jammer
Alle wollen mein Feind sein
Erspar dir das Mitleid
Alle wollen mein Feind-d-d-d-d sein
(Pass auf dich auf)
Mein Feind-d-d-d-d (Pass auf, pass auf, pass auf, pass auf)
(Pass auf dich auf)
Aber ich bin bereit

Deine Worte an der Wand, während du für meinen Niedergang betest
Und das Gelächter in den Hallen und die Beschimpfungen, die mir zugeworfen wurden
Ich sammle sie in meinem Kopf, und ich warte auf die Zeit
Wenn ich euch zeige, wie es ist, Worte zu sein, die in ein Mikrofon gespuckt werden

Sagen dir, du seist der Größte
Aber sobald du dich umdrehst, hassen sie uns (Ha)

Oh, welch ein Jammer
Alle wollen mein Feind sein
Erspar dir das Mitleid
Alle wollen mein Feind-d-d-d-d sein (Pass auf, pass auf, pass auf, pass auf)

Mein Feind-d-d-d-d (Pass auf, pass auf, pass auf, pass auf; yeah)

Ah, schau, okay

Ich hoffe, dass jemand für mich betet
Ich bete, dass jemand für mich hofft
Ich lebe, wo keiner h-h-hingeschickt werden sollte
Bin ein emotionales Wrack
Immer bereit zu gehen, sag einfach Bescheid
Der Weg ist lang, also drück das Pedal in den Boden
Der Feind auf meiner Spur, meine Energie nicht verfügbar
Ich werde denen „Hasta luego“ sagen
Sie wollen sich verschwören auf meinem Weg nach oben
Ich bin außer Form, sehe über den Tellerrand, ich bin ein Astronaut
Ich habe das Planetengestein gesprengt, um eine Katastrophe zu verursachen
Und es zählt mehr, weil ich es nicht getan hätte
Hätte ich daran gedacht, meinen Feinden
Schaden anzurichten, irgendwie schockierend, sie wollten Statik
Mit Präzision, ich bin automatisch Quarterback
Ich rede nicht übers Scheitern, pack's ein
Pack es ein, ich hab' keine Panik, schlage-schlage zu
Wer ist der Beste? Es ist egal, denn wir sind an deinem Hals

Alle wollen mein Feind sein
Erspar dir das Mitleid (Ah)
Alle wollen mein Feind sein
Oh, welch ein Jammer (Ah)
Alle wollen mein Feind sein
Erspar dir das Mitleid (Ah)
Alle wollen mein Feind sein

Bete es fort, ich schwöre, ich werde nie ein Heiliger sein, keine Chance

Sicilim o kadar temiz ki, beni ezip geçmek için sabırsızlanıyorlar
Fazla hızlı parlamış olmalıyım, dünyanın beni gazlamasına izin vermemeliydiniz (Woo)
Artık çok geç çünkü burada kalıcıyım ve bu kızlar benim edepsiz olduğumu biliyor (Mmm)
Onu erkek arkadaşına, kıçındaki el izimle geri gönderdim
Tüm şehir konuşuyorken, notlar alıyoruz
Söyle onlara, paylaşıma devam etsinler
Keşke öldürebilse, ama yaklaşamaz bile yanıma
Üstadım o kadar gurur duyuyor ki benle, kadehini kaldırırken boğazı düğümleniyor
Ben senin kontrol edemeyeceğin türden biriyim, yapacağımı söyledim, sonra da yaptım
Söylentileri aydınlatmam (Ayy), espri anlayışınız nerede? (Ayy)
Şaka yapmaktan bıktım çünkü bebek boomer'lar gibi yaşlandılar
Haterlarımı tüketicilere çevirdim, eskilere kendilerini küçük enişte gibi hissettiriyorum (Küçük)
Zamanının yaklaştığını söyle, ama tıpkı Oklahoma gibi (Mmm)
Benim zamanım daha erken geliyor (Mmm), ben sadece geç büyüdüm (Mmm)
Lisede zirve yapmadım, hala buradayım ve daha da şirinleşiyorum (Woo)
Tüm bu sosyal ağlar ve bilgisayarlar
Bu amcıklar ezik değillermiş gibi etrafta dolaşıyor

Sana uzun zaman önce yolda söylemiştim
Bekledikleri şeyi aldım (Bekledikleri şeyi aldım)
Hiçbir şeyden kaçmam, peşini bırakmam
Askerlerini kap gel ve onlara gizlenmediğimi söyle (Sürtük, hiçbir yerden kaçmıyorum)
Zaten beni hiç desteklememiştin (Ooh, ooh)
Tekrar zirveye çıktığımda, senin şunu dediğini duymak istiyorum
Hiçbir şeyden kaçmıyor, kaçmıyor

And your broke-ass car and that shit you call art
Fuck you and your friends that I'll never see again
Everybody but your dog, you can all fuck off

I swear I meant to mean the best when it ended
Even tried to bite my tongue when you start shit
Now you're textin' all my friends asking questions
They never even liked you in the first place
Dated a girl that I hate for the attention
She only made it two days, what a connection
It's like you'd do anythin' for my affection
You're goin' all about it in the worst ways

I was into you, but I'm ovеr it now

Always had to put yourself above me

And I was tryna be nice
But nothing's getting through, so let me spell it out

I don't always wake up in the mornin', pour myself a strong one
Aw, but when I get lonely I do
Your memory gets to burnin', lean back on the bourbon
Sure as hell can't keep leanin' on you

Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again
It's all my fault, yeah, I dropped the ball
You're gone and I'm gone three sheets to the wind
Thinkin' 'bout all

I've wasted on you
All of this time and all of this money
All of the these sorries I don't owe you honey
All of these miles on this Chevy, and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent wasted on you
Wasted on you

Yeah, I swore this one'd be different, my heart wouldn't listen
To my head and these boots on my feet
Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again
That's why I've been

Wasted on you
All of this time and all of this money
All these sorries I don't owe you, honey
All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent wasted on you
Wasted on you

Like this pile of your stuff that's packed up in a bag
Right down to the flame of this match
Wasted on you, wasted on you
Wasted on you, wasted on you

Wasted on you
All of this time and all of this money
All these sorries I don't owe you, honey
All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent wasted on you
Wasted on you

Wasted on you, wasted on you"

Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, hey
The smell of your perfume is lingering inside the truck
You're horny, I'm horny, that's what unites us
She knows she's hot and they don't show her off
If I was your man, I'd upload a picture on Fridays and Mondays (So)

For the whole world to see how hot you are, you are
With you, I have to go hard
And I'm loose out on the streets, but I'd quit for you
I'll behave nicely if you ask me to
And I upload a selfie so they can see how hot you are, you are
The other girls have to try harder
And I'm loose out on the streets, but I'd quit for you
I'll behave nicely if you ask me to (Ayy, ayy)

You are not a little baby, you are a grand baby
Freaky, bae, I can see it
She likes threesomes when she's high
If the boyfriend ain't no good then she throws him away
And wow, mami, tell me where should I leave the resume (Resume)
I know you left him a month ago (Ayy, ayy)
And I straight up shot my shot
If you want me to, I'll make you a baby or bring you the plan B
Uff, mami, you look so delicious
In the 2000's, she listened to RBD
And now she wants grinding all night long on the wall
THC, not CBD

Mami, you're elite (Hey), don't limit yourself (Okey)
Let me give you what you deserve and levitate you
Let's go to our hiding spot (Hey), don't you cripple me (So)
The satellites won't be able to reach us here
Mami, upload something, give me some content
Upload that ass more often
I'm just hanging around to see if we can run into each other, hey
And finally find you
Bae, I never forget our horny moments
No one has ever pleased me like you did
You think I always say the same thing to all of them
She wants to fuck, but she doesn't want a relationship, hey
But in confidence she confesses to me
How nobody is of her interest
But when she goes out, she gets naughty (Hey)

For the whole world to see how hot you are, you are, hey
With you, I have to go hard
And I'm loose out on the streets, but I'd quit for you
I'll behave nicely if you ask me to"

We don't talk about Bruno, but

It was my wedding day

It was our wedding day

We were getting ready and there wasn't a cloud in the sky

No clouds allowed in the sky

Bruno walks in with a mischievous grin

Thunder!

You telling this story or am I?

I'm sorry, mi vida, go on

Bruno says, ""It looks like rain""

Why did he tell us?

In doing so, he floods my brain

Abuela, get the umbrellas

Married in a hurricane

What a joyous day, but anyway

We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no
We don't talk about Bruno

Hey!
Grew to live in fear of Bruno stuttering or stumbling
I can always hear him sort of muttering and mumbling
I associate him with the sound of falling sand (Ch, ch, ch)
It's a heavy lift with a gift so humbling
Always left Abuela and the family fumbling
Grappling with prophecies they couldn't understand
Do you understand?

A seven-foot frame, rats along his back
When he calls your name, it all fades to black
Yeah, he sees your dreams and feasts on your screams

Hey

We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no (No, no)
We don't talk about Bruno (We don't talk about Bruno)

He told me my fish would die, the next day, dead (No, no)

He told me I'd grow a gut, and just like he said (No, no)

He said that all my hair would disappear, now look at my head (No, no)

Your fate is sealed when your prophecy is read

He told me that the life of my dreams
Would be promised and someday be mine
He told me that my power would grow
Like the grapes that thrive on the vine

Óye, Mariano's on his way

He told me that the man of my dreams
Would be just out of reach, betrothed to another
It's like I hear him now (Hey, sis)
(I want not a sound out of you) It's like I can hear him now
I can hear him now

Um, Bruno
Yeah, about that Bruno
I really need to know about Bruno
Gimme the truth and the whole truth, Bruno

Powiedziałaś, że mnie kochasz, ale mnie to nie obchodzi
Że złamałem rękę na tej samej ścianie
Na której powiedziałaś mi, że on cię przeleciał (Oh)
Myślisz, że łatwo pieprzyć się z moimi uczuciami
Coś przychodzi, coś odchodzi (Uh)
Coś odchodzi
(Coś przychodzi, coś odchodzi, oh)
Coś przychodzi, coś odchodzi

Mówiłaś, że chcesz być matką moich dzieci
Pieprzyłem cię tak dobrze, że powinnaś mi za to płacić
Nie nazywaj mnie ""kochanie"", kiedy potraktowałaś mnie tak źle (Kiedy potraktowałaś mnie tak źle)
Lecz poradziłem sobie już z tym, co mi zrobiłaś
Oko za oko, drobnostka
Ilu twoich znajomych dogania mnie z kasą? (Czy ty jesteś w staniе mieć tyle kasy?)
Kupiłem Ci nową twarz, powinnaś mówić mi ""tato"", kochaniе

Prawda, już może nikomu nie wystarczyć

Powiedziałaś, że mnie kochasz, ale mnie to nie obchodzi

Jesteś skazą mojego dziedzictwa
Nie możemy być przyjaciółmi, nie możemy być rodziną (Oh)
Prawdopodobnie pieprzysz wszystkich moich wrogów (Oh)
Nie mogę ci pozwolić być koło mnie
Oh, należysz teraz do świata
Więc po prostu zostaw mnie już w spokoju
Nie jesteśmy już w kontakcie

Powiedziałaś, że mnie kochasz, ale mnie to nie obchodzi (Nie, nie obchodzi)

I don't feel a single thing
Have the pills done too much?
Haven't caught up with my friends in weeks
And now we're outta touch
I've been drivin' in L.A
And the world, it feels too big
Like a floating ball that's bound to break
Snap my psyche like a twig

And I just wanna see
If you feel the same as me

Do you ever get a little bit tired of life?
Like you're not really happy but you don't wanna die
Like you're hangin' by a thread but you gotta survive
'Cause you gotta survive
Like your body's in the room but you're not really there
Like you have empathy inside but you don't really care
Like you're fresh outta love but it's been in the air
Am I past repair?

A little bit tired of trying to care when I don't
A little bit tired of quick repairs to cope
A little bit tired of sinkin', there's water in my boat
I'm barely breathin', tryna stay afloat
So I got these quick repairs to cope
Guess I'm just broken and broke

The prescription's on its way
With a name I can't pronounce
And the dose I gotta take
Boy, I wish that I could count

'Cause I just wanna see
If this could make me happy

Do you ever get a little bit tired of life?
Like you're not really happy but you don't wanna die
Like you're hangin' by a thread but you gotta survive
'Cause you gotta survive
Like your body's in the room but you're not really there
Like you have empathy inside but you don't really care
Like you're fresh outta love but it's been in the air
Am I past repair?

A little bit tired of trying to care when I don't
A little bit tired of quick repairs to cope
A little bit tired of sinkin', there's water in my boat
I'm barely breathin', tryna stay afloat
So I got these quick repairs to cope

Do you ever get a little bit tired of life?
Like you're not really happy but you don't wanna die
Like a numb little bug that's gotta survive
That's gotta survive"

I would have you courtside, not the middle row

Bustdown everything, set in rose gold
Dread talkin' to you niggas like I'm J. Cole

1038,Something in the Orange,Zach Bryan,"22 ContributorsSomething in the Orange Lyrics
It'll be fine by dusk light, I'm tellin' you, baby
These things eat at your bones and drive your young mind crazy
But when you place your head between my collar and jaw
I don't know much, but there's no weight at all

And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't
'Cause if I say I miss you, I know that you won't
But I miss you in the mornings when I see the sun
Somethin' in the orange tells me we're not done

To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home

I need to hear you say you've been waitin' all night
There's orange dancin' in your eyes from bulb light
Your voice only trembles when you try to speak
Take me back to us dancin', this wood used to creak

To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home

To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home
If you leave today, I'll just stare at the way
The orange touches all things around
The grass, trees, and dew, how I just hate you
Please turn those headlights around
Please turn those headlights around"

I be in the loop, she be in a group (Yeah)
Brodie want her friend, throw 'em alley-oop (Yeah)
Turned somethin' to nothin', bruh, I'm livin' proof
How can I lose when we the who's who's?
Still runnin' 'round with Mohawk, jet ready, pack the Goyard
People probably think I show off, I ain't even give it yet
Runnin' up a silly check, stayin' off the internet
Share the stage with Billie Eilish, turnt at any given time
Personal partners pillow talkin' 'cause I got rich without 'em
Only thing they should be sayin' is, ""Baby keep it solid""
We ain't even deep as we used to be, this shit slick, divided
Bruh ain't got no hustle or nothin', so he gon' stick to violence
I be known to run down, I'm dialed in, so I can't speak about it
She know I'm a gangster, she love me, I bring the freak up out her
Can't play with me, you know I come trim, I'm in a different league
I'm tired of showin' what I can get done, what you gon' do for me?
Forty-thousand miles up in the air, only time I get some Z's
Full-court press, foot on they neck, and I can't let 'em breathe
Blood, sweat, and tears come with this check, it ain't nowhere near easy
Had to fall back, you know how that go, we only speakin' briefly
Hope I'm not too much to handle, city nigga from Atlanta
I spent my last check on ammo, this is not a regular Lambo
Hundred thousand dollars kit, could've put down on another Lambo
Don't be in the mix, I built this shit forever havin' say so
This shit gon' get serious about my money, this ain't no fuckin' Play-Doh
Brodie down for double homicide, I try to tell him, ""Lay low""
C don't like to drive, but he spin good, I'm on the way to Clayco
AK-47s in the spots before they made the Draco

I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill', I'm calling dibs
I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real
Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years
And I'm out here grinding still, I need equity to sign the deal
I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill', I'm calling dibs
I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real
Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years
And I'm out here grinding still, I need equity to sign the deal

Overbuying cars, I snatch the Brabus just for motivation
Shootout at the spot today, tomorrow, we in a new location
Free all of the guys, I hope y'all beat the case or get probation
Stash it at my mama house, four hundred bands in the ventilation
Now look how I'm living, I bought a house for the money to stay at
Right when niggas think that I got soft, I'ma pull up and spray at
Living like a don, might smoke a blunt in the back of the Maybach
Pull up like your mama with the switch, ""Why the fuck would you say that?”
You can do it first, I'ma do it worst, gotta double the pay back Never take it personal, show no mercy, bruh taught me that way back
Condo to get off, I was always taught, ""Don't tell hoes where you stay at""
Keep a stash house, you can't take nothing to the spot where you lay at
Never be a bother, if you off me, no problem, just say that
Never runnin' off, so if I owe you, I got you, I'll pay that
Give this shit my all, so when I'm old, I can chill and just lay back
Really from the bottom so the trenches is where I feel safe at

I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill', I'm calling dibs
I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real
Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years
And I'm out here grinding still, I need equity to sign the deal
I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill', I'm calling dibs
I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real
Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years
And I'm out here grinding still, I need equity to sign the deal"

I was out with the boys, catchin' up in a neon light
Didn't know 'til we walked in it was karaoke night
She was in a circle of girls, chasin' a shot with a lime
She was laughin', they were darin' her to get on the mic
One of 'em walked up and turned in her name
Next thing I knew, man, she was up on the stage, singin'

""Heads Carolina, tails California""
Maybe she'd fall for a boy from South Georgia
She's got the bar in the palm of her hand
And she's a '90s country fan like I am
Hey, I got a Chevy, she can flip a quarter
I'd drive hеr anywhere from herе to California
When this song is over, I gotta find her
'Cause she had me at ""Heads Carolina""

Yeah, she knew every word by heart, didn't need no screen, no
I was raisin' my glass up for her, I saw her smilin' at me, yeah
She had me down in the front by the end of verse two
Like there wasn't no one else in the room, we were singin'

""Heads Carolina, tails California""
Maybe she'd fall for a boy from South Georgia
She's got the bar in the palm of her hand
And she's a '90s country fan like I am
Hey, I got a Chevy, she can flip a quarter
I'd drive her anywhere from here to California
When this song is over, I gotta find her
'Cause she had me at ""Heads Carolina""

Yeah, I bought her a round and we talked 'til the lights came on
I still see that girl every time I hear that song

Поставил медную рукоять на пистолет, мы не хотим мир
Есть хата прямо напротив хаты чисто для P
Поделился точкой, дальше строим планы, экзотичные P

Благодаря большой P, у меня полно дохлых президентов, подсчитаю президентов

Она дала потискать, потом ушла, потому она оставила P
Приватный номер, приватные места, сука, я живу, как P
Пинта пойла, писька порозовела, сука, я живу, как P

Живу, как P, я живу, как P, живу, как P, я живу, как P, е (Знаю чё говорю)

Few days before he turned 80
He was sitting out back in a rocker
He said ""What you been up to lately?""
I told him chasing a dollar
And in between sips of coffee
He poured this wisdom out
Said ""If you want my two cents on making a dollar count

Buy dirt
Find the one you can't live without
Get a ring, let your knee hit the ground
Do what you love but call it work
And throw a little money in the plate at church
Send your prayers up and your roots down deep
Add a few limbs to your family tree
And watch their pencils marks, and the grass in the yard
All grow up
'Cause the truth about it is it all goes by real quick
You can't buy happiness
But you can buy dirt""

Before you get caught on that ladder
Let me tell you what it's all about
Find you a few things that matter
That you can put a fence around
And then he laid it out

Buy dirt
Find the one you can't live without
Get a ring, let your knee hit the ground
Do what you love but call it work
And throw a little money in the plate at church
Send you prayers up and your roots down deep
And add a few limbs to your family tree
And watch their pencils marks, and the grass in the yard
All grow up
'Cause the truth about it is it all goes by real quick
You can't buy happiness
But you can buy dirt

You can buy dirt
And thank the good Lord for it
'Cause He ain't makin' any more of it

So buy dirt
Find the one you can't live without
Get a ring, let your knee hit the ground
Do what you love but call it work
And throw a little money in the plate at church
Send your prayers up and your roots down deep
Add a few limbs to your family tree
And watch their pencils marks, and the grass in the yard
All grow up
'Cause the truth about it is it all goes by real quick
You can't buy happiness
But you can buy dirt"
1049,I Hate U,SZA,"I be so sick of you niggas, y'all contradicting
I be so bored with myself, can you come and fuck me?
I feel so ordinary, sad when you around me
Treat me like corduroy, wear me out
Arguments, you air me out
Tripping 'bout your whereabouts
I can't keep no conflict with you, boy, can we just rub it out?
I don't want no static with you, you know you my plug
And I can't shake this habit, no

I've been up, baby
Heavy reminiscin'
Heavy on the missing you
Wish it was different than what it was (Oh, no)
I've been up, baby
Lost in the lie of us
Lost, ain't no findin' us
I've been up, baby

And if you wonder if I hate you (I do)
Shitty of you to make me feel just like this
What I would do to make you feel just like this
And if you wondered if I hate you (Fuck you)
Shitty of you to make me feel just likе this
What I would do to make you feel just like this

Used to bе too solid 'til you scrambled me
Used to be your rider, you mishandle me
Used to be nonviolent 'til you ambushed me
Now I'm out here wildin' with you
Now I'm out here, silent treatment, that mean no permission (No)
Missionary gettin' boring, can you switch positions? (Yeah)
Hard to save your soul, you don't ever listen, no (No)

I've been up, baby
Heavy reminiscin'
Heavy on the missing you
Wish it was different than what it was (Oh, no)
I've been up, baby
Lost in the lie of us
Lost, ain't no findin' us
I've been up, baby

And if you wonder if I hate you (I do)
Shitty of you to make me feel just like this
What I would do to make you feel just like this
And if you wondered if I hate you (Fuck you)
Shitty of you to make me feel just like this
What I would do to make you feel just like this"
1050,Boyfriend,Dove Cameron,"I can't believe we're finally alone
I can't believe I almost went home
What are the chances? Everyone's dancing
And he's not with you (Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm)

The universe must have divined this
What am I gonna do? Not grab your wrist?

I could be a better boyfriend than him
I could do the shit that he never did
Up all night, I won't quit
Thinking I'm gonna steal you from him
I could be such a gentleman
Plus all my clothes would fit
I could be a better boyfriend

I don't need to tell you twice
All the ways hе can't suffice
If I could give you some advicе
I would leave with me tonight

The universe must have divined this (Mmm, mmm)
Ladies first, baby, I insist
I could be a better boyfriend than him
I could do the shit that he never did
Up all night, I won't quit
Thinking I'm gonna steal you from him
I could be such a gentleman
Plus all my clothes would fit
I could be a better boyfriend than him
I could be a better boyfriend

I never would have left you alone
Here on your own, glued to your phone
Never would have left you alone
For someone else to take you home

I could be a better boyfriend than him
I could do the shit that he never did
Up all night, I won't quit
I'm gonna steal you from him
I could be such a gentleman
Plus you know my clothes would fit
I could be a better boyfriend than him
I could do the shit that he never did
Up all night, I won't quit
Thinking I'm gonna steal you from him
I could be such a gentleman
Plus all my clothes would fit"
1051,Glimpse of Us,Joji,"She'd take the world off my shoulders
If it was ever hard to move
She'd turn the rain to a rainbow
When I was living in the blue
Why then, if she's so perfect
Do I still wish that it was you?
Perfect don't mean that it's workin'
So what can I do? (Ooh)

When you're out of sight
In my mind

'Cause sometimes, I look in her eyes
And that's where I find a glimpse of us
And I try to fall for her touch
But I'm thinkin' of the way it was
Said I'm fine and said I moved on
I'm only here passing time in her arms
Hopin' I'll find a glimpse of us

Tell me he savors your glory
Does he laugh the way I did?
Is this a part of your story?
One that I had never lived
Maybe one day, you'll feel lonely
And in his eyes, you'll get a glimpse
Maybe you'll start slippin' slowly and find me again

When you're out of sight
In my mind

'Cause sometimes, I look in her eyes
And that's where I find a glimpse of us
And I try to fall for her touch
But I'm thinkin' of the way it was
Said I'm fine and said I moved on
I'm only here passing time in her arms
Hopin' I'll find a glimpse of us

Ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

'Cause sometimes, I look in her eyes
And that's where I find a glimpse of us
And I try to fall for her touch
But I'm thinkin' of the way it was
Said I'm fine and said I moved on
I'm only here passing time in her arms
Hopin' I'll find a glimpse of us"
1052,Surface Pressure,Jessica Darrow,"I'm the strong one, I'm not nervous
I'm as tough as the crust of the Earth is
I move mountains, I move churches
And I glow 'cause I know what my worth is
I don't ask how hard the work is
Got a rough, indestructible surface
Diamonds and platinum, I find 'em, I flatten 'em
I take what I'm handed, I break what's demanded, but
Under the surface
I feel berserk as a tightrope walker in a three-ring circus
Under the surface
Was Hercules ever like, ""Yo, I don't wanna fight Cerberus""?
Under the surface
I'm pretty surе I'm worthless if I can't be of servicе
A flaw or a crack, the straw in the stack
That breaks the camel's back, what breaks the camel's back? It's
Pressure like a drip, drip, drip that'll never stop, woah
Pressure that'll tip, tip, tip 'til you just go pop, woah, oh, oh
Give it to your sister, your sister's older
Give her all the heavy things we can't shoulder
Who am I if I can't run with the ball?
If I fall to
Pressure like a grip, grip, grip, and it won't let go, woah
Pressure like a tick, tick, tick 'til it's ready to blow, woah, oh, oh
Give it to your sister, your sister's stronger
See if she can hang on a little longer
Who am I if I can't carry it all?
If I falter

Under the surface
I hide my nerves, and it worsens, I worry somethin' is gonna hurt us
Under the surface
The ship doesn't swerve, has it heard how big the iceberg is?
Under the surface
I think about my purpose, can I somehow preserve this?
Line up the dominoes, a light wind blows
You try to stop it topplin', but on and on it goes
But wait
If I could shake
The crushing weight
Of expectations, would that free some room up for joy
Or relaxation?
Or simple pleasure?
Instead, we measure
This growing pressure
Keeps growing, keep going
'Cause all we know is
Pressure like a drip, drip, drip that'll never stop, woah
Pressure that'll tip, tip, tip 'til you just go pop, woah, oh, oh
Give it to your sister, it doesn't hurt, and
See if she can handle every family burden
Watch as she buckles and bends but never breaks
No mistakes, just
Pressure like a grip, grip, grip, and it won't let go, woah
Pressure like a tick, tick, tick 'til it's ready to blow, woah, oh, oh
Give it to your sister and never wonder
If the same pressure would've pulled you under
Who am I if I don't have what it takes?
No cracks, no breaks
No mistakes, no pressure"
1053,Fall in Love,Bailey Zimmerman,"14 ContributorsFall In Love Lyrics
Heard you moved out to South Carolina
Just like you always said we would
Packed your bags in that old 4Runner
That I bought you when things were good
I'm glad to see the stop sign didn't hit ya
Bring you back to your senses
Oh, it waved you gone, goodbye
Yeah, it waved you gone, goodbye

I heard you found yourself a brand-new man
Put a rock on your finger and he vowed you a second chance
Built a house right by the coast
That ocean view is beautiful, but baby, I just want you to know
He don't know you like I did
Money talks, but I ain't buyin'

'Cause love's a smoke ring wrapped around your finger
One second, it's a blessin', and the next, it's already gone
A broken heart, I'm a walkin' testimony
My confession is a lesson that I'm pourin' out in this song
Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah
You don't wanna fall in love
Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah
You don't wanna fall in love

I seen your mama walkin' out the county market
And I stopped to ask her how she's been
Said she's missin' ya and tried to go convincin' ya
Not to settle down with him
She ain't wrong, the whole town knows it
You had a bed of roses, but girl, you couldn't walk that line
You can act like you're doin' fine

'Cause love's a smoke ring wrapped around your finger
One second, it's a blessin', and the next, it's already gone
A broken heart, I'm a walkin' testimony
My confession is a lesson that I'm pourin' out in this song
Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah
You don't wanna fall in love
Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah
You don't wanna fall in love


'Cause love's a smoke ring wrapped around your finger
One second, it's a blessin', and the next, it's already gone
A broken heart, I'm a walkin' testimony
My confession is a lesson that I'm pourin' out in this song
Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah
You don't wanna fall in love
Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah
You don't wanna fall in love
Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah
You don't wanna fall in love

Sit and talk to you for hours
I wanna give you your flowers
And some champagne showers
Order shrimp and lobster towers
But it's me that gets devoured
Ooh, when you do what you do, I'm empowered
You give me a superpower
Together the world could be ours
You sit me up on the counter
Instantly, it's thunder showers
Stormin' for a couple hours
When we finished, take a shower

I said, ""Somewhere ya never been to
Little town outside of Knoxville""
Hidden by some dogwood trees
She tried talkin' with my accent
We held hands and waded into
That blue water, she left her flip-flops
By my Red Wings on the beach

Yeah, but now I'm dodgin' potholes
In my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado
Headed right back to my roots
Somethin' 'bout the way she kissеd me
Tells me shе'd love Eastern Tennessee
Yeah, but all I brought back with me
Was some sand in my boots

I said, ""Let's go shoot tequila""
So, we walked back to that beach bar
She said, ""Don't cowboys drink whiskey?"" (Huh)
So, we drank bottom shelf
She said, ""Damn, that sky looks perfect""
I said, ""Girl, you've never seen stars
Like the ones back home""
And she said, ""Maybe I should, see 'em for myself""

Yeah, but now I'm dodgin' potholes
In my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado
Headed right back to my roots
Somethin' 'bout the way she kissed me
Tells me she'd love Eastern Tennessee
Yeah, but all I brought back with me
Was some sand in my boots

I said, ""Meet me in the mornin'""
And she told me I was crazy
Yeah, but I still thought that maybe she'd show up

Aw, but now I'm dodgin' potholes
In my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado
Headed right back to my roots
Somethin' 'bout the way she kissed me
Tells me she'd love Eastern Tennessee
Yeah, but all I brought back with me

O-O-Ovy On The Drums
Cheers, mami
Ah, ah, ah, ay

What doesn't help, don't let it get in the way
You made an own goal for being clumsy
The torque turned out to be too big for you
I'm not for you to fall in love with anymore, baby (Chi)
Without a Visa or passport
I sent your fake love on a vacation (Chi, chi, chi, chi, chi, chi)
Fuck off and don't come back
I hope you get everything you deserve, no
For what you did to me if you don't remember

Don't call me again, I threw out the phone
Because of how toxic you are, it became harmful
What goes, goes
Don't misunderstand me
Bеcause of how toxic you are, I don't want to see you again (Chi)

I got to the party, takе the bottle out
The one that loved you, I don't know who she is
I left you a review, I didn't give you even one star
And I forgot you because you didn't leave footprints
I don't look back anymore, not even to park
I have one that's ready to take me
The second is waiting in the hotel
And the third, I'll meet him tonight (No, no)
Don't call me, 'cause I changed my number (Changed)
If you want me to give it you (Give)
Call 1-800-go fuck yourself
I don't know if you heard me
Don't call me, 'cause I changed my number (Changed)
If you want me to give it you (Give)
Call 1-800-go fuck yourself

Don't call me again, I even threw out the phone
Because of how toxic you are, it became harmful
What goes, goes, ah-ah
Don't misunderstand me
Because of how toxic you are, I don't want to see you again (Ayy)

Ay, I'm sorry (Ah)
You're desire to come back (Ayy) died in the attempt (Ah)
You made it look like you lost time
You came out well because I don't even count mine (Papi)
I see you on social media, I can't believe it, what a shame (What a shame)
I was good and you such trash paying me back like that (Wow, such trash)
Rat with two feet, Paquita said it
A creeping animal (Haha)
That eats everything he finds
Damn, you're a whore (Whore)
Don't say ""I adore you"", instead be honest (Ayy)
Don't say ""I love you"" (Ah) because that was in vain (Ah)
You were crying and since I didn't get with you
You're eating another, but you're thinking of me (Chi)

Don't call me again, I even threw out the phone
Because of how toxic you are, it became harmful
What goes, goes, ah-ah
Don't misunderstand me
Because of how toxic you are, I don't want to see you again

Tell the coach don't take me out, I like to finish games
And my pen insane, am I menacin'?
There's like eighty of us now, that's the scary thing
Shit they doin' on that other side embarrassing

Alright
Coffee cup, cold and black
Wish you had a little shot of jack
Besides that, can't complain
Just tryin' to do the dang thing
Might change the oil in my truck
I ain't payin' no thirty-five bucks
Kids need shoes, mama needs Levi's

And I'm just tryna keep my daughters off the pole
And my sons out of jail
Tryna get to church so I don't go to hell
I'm just tryna keep my wife from figuring out
That I married up and she married way, way down

Tryna write a song the local country station will play
Hey, I'm just tryna stay out of AA (AA, ooh)

Well I gave up Skoal and cigarettes
Now I'm just hooked on Nicorette
Trying not to be like my old man
But the older I get, the more I am
Tryna get paid and a little love made, y'all
Hey, y'all, at the end of the day, y'all
I'm just another John Deere guy (Hey)
Up on a tractor

And my sons out of jail (Sons out of jail)
Tryna get to church so I don't go to hell (I don't wanna go)

Tell you, ooh-ooh-ooh, tryna stay out of AA every day

Uh, este es el viaje de tu vida
Resiste porque, cariño, puede
Puede que te dé un bocado del pastel más dulce (Sí, sí, ah)
Uh, cariño, podemos ir rápido
Yo conduzco y tú te recuestas
Tengo el sabor que dura (Uhum, uhum), sí, el pastel más dulce
Puede que te lleve a casa con este, puеde que te lo dé todo (Sí)
Vеn por tu dosis del pastel más dulce
Uh, este es el viaje de tu vida, resiste porque, cariño, puede que
Puede que te dé un bocado (Uhum) del pastel más dulce (Uhum)

Cariño, soy la más dulce, la vagina es la más mala (Sí)
Mierda de chica caliente, pero soy fría cada temporada (Pero soy)
Sabe que tiene esa pipa, dejo que la rompa hasta que gotee (Sí, mwah)
Trasero como una almohada, dejo que lo use mientras duerme (Mira)
No revises mi teléfono porque esa es la vieja yo (Vieja yo)
No eres el único que intenta ser mi único y exclusivo (Intenta)
Realmente grueso, lo muevo lentamente, ese cuerpo es como codeína
Él es un jugador (Ey) pero por Megan (Ey) él corta (Ey) todo el equipo (Hey)
Ese cuerpo se ve bien (Se ve bien)
Tengo pastel y sé que quiere una rebanada
Me gustaría que un negro tratara de ponerme en hielo (Brrr)
Nunca he tenido que perseguir una polla en mi vida (En mi vida)
Quiero esa cosa asquerosa, esa cosa rara (Cosa rara)
Que se deslize abajo de mi cama y me mantega despierta (Hey)
Ese Hansel y Gretel, dejo que me coma (Ah)
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

Uh, este es el viaje de tu vida (Sí, sí, sí)

Uh, este es el viaje de tu vida, resiste porque, cariño, puede que
Puede que te dé un bocado (Uhum) del pastel más dulce (Uhum)

Me tienes colgando desde el otro lado de la habitación
Estoy tan drogada que estoy en otra altitud
Y en mi nube tengo espacio para ti
Tengo una probada para ti, ayy

Más rebote a la onza, recogelo, ponlo abajo (Whoa)
Quiero poner su Nutty Buddy en mi Fudge Round (Ow)
Vagina más apretada que una perra, no lo ha tenido así
Dedos de los pies curvados como si lanzaran signos de pandillas en Crip (En Crip)
Una cosa sobre mí, no estoy tomando ninguna mierda
Está azotado, sé que se está cabreando su perra anterior
Caesar Milan, tengo su culo entrenado (Tengo su culo entrenado)
Estoy tratando de hacer que un perro sepa quién realmente da las órdenes

Nunca has estado en el cielo (Uh), ¿verdad?

Uh, este es el viaje de tu vida
Resiste porque, cariño, puede
Puede que te dé un bocado (Aham) del (Aham) pastel más dulce
Uh, cariño, podemos ir rápido

Jack makes good whiskey, yeah

Country makes good music
For kicking up dust in a taillight glow
Dry wood makes good fires
Goodyears make good swings
All that's all good, but for me

God makes five-foot-nine, brown eyes in a sundress
Loves Tim McGraw and a small-town accent
Ain't no way that me and this truck made her fall in love
Jack makes good whiskey, but God makes the good stuff

Oh, God makes the good stuff

Like that sweet little kiss she lays on me
When I pull up in the gravel drive
The way she dances with the raindrops
Like she's the reason why they fall from the sky
And I thank Him every time I close my eyes

God makes five-foot-nine, brown eyes in a sundress
Loves Tim McGraw and a small-town accent
Ain't no way that me and this truck made her fall in love
Jack makes good whiskey, but God makes the good stuff

God made her, so I'ma make sure
He didn't waste an angel on me

When He made five-foot-nine, brown eyes in a sundress
Loves Tim McGraw and a small-town accent
Ain't no way that me and this truck made her fall in love
Jack makes good whiskey, but God makes the good stuff
Five-foot-nine, brown eyes in a sundress

We've been swingin’ and missin'
It ain't broke yet, but damn, it needs fixin’
Been a while since your kiss felt like kissin'
It's just different

We've been talkin' 'bout forever since we been together
Somethin' 'bout a ring makes you think we’re better
Off with all this, but we’re caught in-between

A rock and a hard place
Red wine and mistakes
Tears rollin' down your face
When I walked out that door
That’s when I lost it
Midnight in Austin
Damn, I'm exhausted
What the hell's this all for?
Is this where it mеnds or it breaks?
Between a rock and a hard place

For thе record (Shit)
Throwin' in the towel takes some effort
So I’d rather ride it out for better weather
Together

Between a rock and a hard place
Red wine and mistakes
Tears rollin' down your face
When I walked out that door
That's when I lost it
Midnight in Austin
Damn, I'm exhausted
What the hell's this all for?
Is this where it mends or it breaks?
Between a rock and a hard place

We've been talkin' 'bout forever since we been together
Somethin' 'bout a ring makes you think we're better
Off with all this, but we're caught in-between

A rock and a hard place
Tears rollin' down your face
As I walked out that door

How much more of this can we take?"
1070,Doin' This,Luke Combs,"9 ContributorsDoin’ This Lyrics
Someone asked me once in an interview
""What was growing up like?""
""Where'd you go to school?""
""And what would you do if you weren't doin' this?""
I'd be drivin' my first car, an old worn-out Dodge
Tryin' to make rent with a dead-end job, just makin' due
With tips in a jar, my guitar, and an old barstool

I'd have a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand
Cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band
Singin' them same damn songs like I am now
I'd be feelin' on fire on a hardwood stage
Bright lights like lightning runnin' through my veins
At the Grand Ole Opry or a show in some no-name town
I'd still be doin' this if I weren't doin' this

I'd still be the same guy they knew back in the day
Who was burnin' CD's just to give away
Payin' his dues
If I wasn't doin' this
Five deep in a van, head full of steam
Hot on the heels of my neon dreams maybe comin' true
Livin' this life just like I was born to do

I'd have a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand
Cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band
Singin' them same damn songs like I am now
I'd be feelin' on fire on a hardwood stage
Bright lights like lightning runnin' through my veins
At the Grand Ole Opry or a show in some no-name town
I'd still be doin' this if I weren't doin' this

It ain't about the fame
It ain't about the fortune
It ain't about the name
It ain't about the glory
I guess I'm sayin' it's always been about

I'd have a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand
Cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band
Singin' them same damn songs like I am now
I'd be feelin' on fire on a hardwood stage
Bright lights like lightning runnin' through my veins
At the Grand Ole Opry or a show in some no-name town
I'd still be doin' this if I weren't doin' this

Uh, uh
Can I get a ""amen""? Introverted, can't make friends
Pray for better days, now it's three hundred K when my day ends
Do you remember last night? 'Cause I blacked out
In that all white dress with her back out
Said be careful with her heart 'cause it's fragile
And thinkin' 'bout her past make her lash out
See, with me, it ain't no worries at all
Any problem, I'll be there, one call
If we locked in, you my dawg
Fan of you, I hang pictures on my wall
Roll one, let's get high tonight
Backseat, Maybach, lavish life
Chillin' with the stars like a satellite
AP on my arm and it's shinin' bright, uh

All I do is sit around and wait for better days (Oh, I sit around and wait)
I could use a break, can I get an ""amen""? (Amen)
All I do is sit around and wait for better days

Sit around, sit around, sit around and wait
For better, better, better days, oh
I could use a break, oh

For better days, no, no

Oh no, no, no
All I do is sit around and wait for better days

Said we'd always put each other first
Old love songs we used to play to
Funny, now I hate you

Now, I
Remember when you'd call me late at night
I gave you my hours and advice just tryna fix you
And all your daddy issues
But now, I don't even miss you anymore
So, I
I want all the tears back that I cried
All the hours spent givin' advice on how to write your songs
All you did was prove me wrong
When you said you loved me
Well, you must've had your fingers crossed

Shoulda paid attention to my friends
Tellin' me how bad it's gonna end
Always givin' their opinions
Now I wish I would have listened

I could say I'm sorry, but I'm not
You don't deserve the one thing that you lost

Remember when you'd call me late at night
And I gave you my hours and advice just tryna fix you

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me

And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well, yeah

And maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again
Just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
Too well

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well"

But she doesn't upload anything on social media
Oh-oh (No, no), she makes me overthink
Today she wants to flow, she's tired of thinking
She rolls it up and starts smoking, ah-ayy (Ayy)
She wants to let loose today
She doesn't want any strings attached, she just wants

She looked in the mirror (Woo!)
And noticed she was fine, and noticed she was fine
She wants to grind and get high
I'll smack that ass
Whenever you want, ready for you to gеt horny
And to grind it with you all-all night
They just open up their wallеts
We left without anybody noticing
Baby, how greedy
You want to do it with two and I doubt you can handle it (Ayy)
There are so many seats
And you still want to sit on top of my dick
I've made your pussy sentimental, uh
And your panties are wet
Still pretty high, it hasn't come down
She says she's single but she hasn't broken up
And that she dares to do it with Benito and Rauw, hehe
I like you, I like you
We left Threehouse and left to Ocean Park
Running Can-Am, drinking champagne
I'll buy you a Taycan tomorrow

Ayy, ayy, you move deliciously, like those of E11EVEN
She knows she's fine and she shows off since she can
I'm willing and you're willing, but who dares?
Tell me who dares
Because in the hotel there will be an after—

Pretty nasty foreplay (Uh-huh)
A real booty, but her boobs are plastic (Eeh-eeh)
She has an abdomen, it looks like she does fasting (Ayy)
And now when she eats it, she swallows, she doesn't chew, ayy
Now she's a full ten, forty hours of flirting (Ah)
Wheeling the Four Truck, she likes what's illicit (Woh)
She left him behind, she flipped off her ex (Ayy)
She asks for El Zorro and El Conejo while twerking (Ya!)
Tell me if you want candy
While running away, we got lost in Santurce (Oh-oh)
In the club, may the lights be turned off (Yeah-yeah)
That booty is for you to use (Yeah-yeah)
Tell me, I'll let you abuse me
You have me in a loop
Before it gets in she spits on it (Mami)
I made her ride it and on the bed, we had a— (Ya!)

And we both know where this is gonna lead
You want me to say that I want you to stay
So you should probably leave

There's still time for you to finish your wine
Then you should probably leave
And it's hard to resist, alright, just one kiss
Then you should probably leave

'Cause I know you and you know me
And we both know where this is gonna lead
You want me to say that I want you to stay
So you should probably leave

Like a devil on my shoulder, you keep whisperin' in my ear
And it's gettin' kinda hard for me to do the right thing here
I wanna do the right thing, baby

Sun on your skin, 6AM
And I been watchin' you sleep
And honey, I'm so afraid you're gonna wake up and say

Let the Christmas spirit ring

And we'll do some caroling

Deck the halls with boughs of holly""

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancin' merrily
In the new old-fashioned way

She's puttin’ her number in my phone (Broadway girls alone)
Two Bud Lights deep, and she's sayin' things she don’t mean
And you know

I met her down at Aldean's
She said that she saw me walkin' in about a mile away
Bean just had to take her phone and that just took her smile away
She said I'm too drunk and crazy, she don't like the way I dance
I said, ""You don't have to join in,"" she said she'd take a chance
I've been kinda crazy ever since it went down
I get kind of lost, and, baby, this what I found
Girls like you just wanna take me around, around and around

Oh, there’s two things that you’re gonna find out
They don't love you and they only love you right now
If I was smarter, I’da stayed my ass at home
And leave them Broadway girls alone (Leave 'em alone, leave 'em alone)
Them Broadway girls alone (Leave 'em alone, leave ’em alone)
Leave them Broadway girls alone

They town just told me, ""Don't trust 'em""
Broadway girls a trap
They on me, they tryna finesse me
They see me with Morgan and know that I rap
My horse is Porsches, turnin' me on
I jump on a horse, she get on the back
I went to the bar to go buy her a drink
She listen to P!nk, she told me she not into rap
I can't run out of money
The trenches love me forever
They treat me like Ed in London
Take her to pool, then got a beer for nothin'
Tecovas boots, guitar, cigar, the bar
She ridin' a bull like cars, she usually don't cool with stars

Now, there's two things that you're gonna find out
They don't love you and they only love you right now
If I was smarter, I'da stayed my ass at home
And leave them Broadway girls alone
Broadway girls, Broadway girls
Them Broadway girls alone
Broadway girls, Broadway girls
Them Broadway girls alone

Oh, think I oughta settle down
And find me somethin' I can take back to my hometown, oh
But I told 'em that I'm savage
They just tryna tell me there's

They don't love you and they only love you right now
If I was smarter, I'da stayed my ass at home
And leave them Broadway girls alone
Two things that you're gonna find out

But magically, I got the strategy, I was so sick and tired of niggas keep asking me
""Who was the killers between the hood?"" (DJ on the beat, so it's a banger)
Bro, I'm a king, that mean we good
Talked to my tete about my problems
Learned to survive, I carry my chopper
Before I was twelve, I went to the doctor
Fucked on a stripper and I took me a Roxy
How you my blood and you say you gon' pop me?
Fall over loyalty, never 'bout thotties
Don't mention my name if you mentionin' bodies
Don't mention my name if you mentionin' bodies
Stopped taking drugs, had to sit in a sauna
How you gon' blame me? I gave her Gabbana
Bitch, I'm a star, gotta use condom
Don't drink Par, only like Wocka
Sippin' on Wocka, I feel like I'm Flocka
Shit in my pocket, that shit'll go blocka
Say that I'm mean, what you mean? I caught you
Get away from her, high speed, no tossin'
Called you a bitch, I'm sorry I lost you
Head down, X pill, Percocet, off it
Bitch, my phone died, pass me a charger
Ain't have a coat, walked to school in a thermal
Bitches you lookin' up to, they'll burn you
Get out my business, that shit don't concern you
I get to diggin' this shit when I learn you
I love the trenches, this shit is eternal
Oh my God, what happened to Virgil?
I wish my brother had made it out surgery
I be up thinkin', that shit do be hurtin' me
If they gon' catch me, them niggas gon' murder me (Oh no, oh)
Gave my bro twenty, he caught for a burglary
I love the bitches who say they ain't heard of me
Ever seen blood? That shit'll turn burgundy

Oh my God, what happened to Virgil?
Oh my God, what happened to Virgil?

Fresh like the first day of school, I'm a scholar
Found the solution and got some more problems
We from the sandbox, my dawg since a toddler
Sixteen years old when I shot my first chopper
Flew out of Van Nuys, landed in Opa-locka
Quit flyin' in G5, fly helicopters (Fly helicopters)
I count every blessin', they count every dollar
I'm 'bout to go factory plain
I treat all of my dawgs the same
Take care all of my bitches the same
I just hope you financially sane
Never turning my back on the gang
From the A, we was taught to be brave
Had to squabble and take a few fades
Stay rock solid, you'll get through the phase
Damn my nigga, what happened to Virgil?
Talked to God, I don't wanna get murdered
I got style, I don't know what you heard of
You lil' pussy, you soft and fertile
Only real ones throughout my circle
Only real ones throughout my circle, oh
R.I.P. Prince, I'ma pour up some purple
600 Maybach, the one with the curtain
Young GunnaWunna, the boy bought the Birkin
I'm goin' hard, know you proud of me workin'
Ridin' round the town sippin' and swervin'
Hold it down, do this shit with a purpose
Louis down, man, this shit came from Virgil

Oh my God, what happened to Virgil?"

Put a switch on it, these lil' niggas whack
After I hit your bitch, givin' her back
Ain't got no roof, put her heart on a strap
Go to the moon, ain't gon' show you no slatt
Pluto tycoon, ain't no regular 'Cat
Took a few shrooms, I forget where I'm at
Poppin' a Tesla, I feel when it kick

G5 the flight, nigga, can't even see me
I'm way outta here, I'm too far in the sky
Hermès ashtray to dump my ashes
Bitch so pretty, look better than Cassie
Puffin' on zooties and she callin' me daddy
Walkin' on shit, turn it up and I gas it
Came out the gutter, it ain't nothin' for me to swag it
Secure the bag, got a bitch, I'ma bag it
Turnin' it up, gotta make sure shit good
Park it, two mil' in the middle of my hood
Drinkin' on mud, I made it out of the sewer
Chrome Heart accessories, whatever, I'm good
Lot of these niggas, they lookin' the same
They copy my lingo, they bitin' my chain
Championship, championship, Range just gon' amp this shit
Bitch break her neck just to look at the kid"

Let's get it

Girl, you gone and done it to me, hotter than a hoochie-coochie
Got me like the first time I heard Alan Jackson ""Chattahoochee""
I was never the same again, I'm a lifelong fan
Yes, I am

Baby, I love you like I love country music

You get me high as Willie, girl, you get me gone as Jones
You turn me on as much as I turn on my radio
Let's take our time, walk the line kinda like
Johnny and June did, yeah, let's do this
Baby, I love you like I love country music

'Causе I could never live without ya or my favoritе songs about ya
Top-to-bottom perfect, you're like Brooks & Dunn's debut album
You got me feelin' like I'm a brand new man (Oh, I'm a brand new man)
Yes, I am

Baby, I love you like I love country music
(Yeah, I love country music, oh)

You get me high as Willie, girl, you get me gone as Jones
You turn me on as much as I turn on my radio

Baby, I love you like I love country music

Hit 'em with it, woo
Play that fiddle

If I was stranded on an island, only way I could survive is
If I had you and that needle droppin' on a vinyl

You get me high as Willie, girl, you get me gone as Jones
You turn me on as much as I turn on my radio
Let's take our time, walk the line kinda like
Johnny and June did, yeah, let's do this
Baby, I love you like I love country music
Oh, baby, I love you like I love country music

Yeah, that's right

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowin' and blowin' up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air

What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh

Giddy up, jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jinglin' feet
That's the jingle bell rock

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air

What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh

Giddy up, jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock

I have listened to my heart for a long time
And the days and months pass, thinking of your smell (Your smell, your smell)
The time has come to start reasoning
Before it's too late and I accidentally break in half (Break in half)

Before the sun comes up, step on the gas
Even if you don't have a brake and lose control
It'll only be us two, you and I caressing each other
In the midst of time, not saying goodbye

And just look at me with those pretty eyes
'Cause with that, I am finе, today I have been reborn

I haven't hеld somebody's hand in a while
I haven't sent a ""Good morning, I love you"" in a while
But you've got me entangled, I got involved
I was on my own way and I got lost (Ayy, ayy)
My gaze changed when I saw your eyes (Your eyes)
Bye-bye to the booties, I didn't even say goodbye to them
I didn't look for you, no, we bumped into each other through our path
Your soul is the one I connect with (Street)
Stay calm, it doesn't have to be perfect, no
There are no sins here and making mistakes is beautiful
Mistakes are pleasures, just like all your little kisses

And just look at me with those pretty eyes
'Cause with that I am fine, today I have been reborn
And just look at me with those pretty eyes
'Cause with that I am fine, today I have been reborn

You and I, you and I, you and I
You and I, you and I
You and I, you and I, you and I
You and I, you and I
You and I, you and I
You and I, you and I

I don't allow myself to be carried away
I only get carried away by your smile
And the mole near your lips
If I'm crazy, you're crazier
But baby, there's nobody like you, no
I want to give you sunflowers
Go to the beach and get seashells for you
When I'm with you, I don't look at the Role'
Let's dance to two hundred songs
Nobody turns me on the way you do
Mm-mmm, mm-mmm-mmm-mmm
Mm-mmm, mm-mmm-mmm-mmm
I talk to God and you are his answer
I learned that pretty moments are priceless
Like when you gift me your gaze
And the sun its setting and the sun its setting
Hey, hey, when I'm on top of you, of you
Mami, I forget everything, everything
Nobody is needed here, just you and me

Before the sun comes up, step on the gas
Even if you don't have a brake and lose control
It'll only be us two, you and I caressing each other
In the midst of time, not saying goodbye

And just look at me with those pretty eyes
'Cause with that I am fine, today I have been reborn
And just look at me with those pretty eyes
'Cause with that I am fine, today I have been reborn"

Don't let anybody tell ya it's gonna be easy ('Cause it ain't easy, no)
Don't let anyone tell ya they know what it's like
Mmh, when they say, ""Get out on this town, meet somebody new""
Get lost in a crowd, all I see is you

Leave you midnight breakin' down, wonderin' how
Long that it's gonna take gettin' over her
It's a can't drown, whiskey down, kinda hurt
Yеah, you can burn them four wheels up that road
But there ain't nowhеre her memory can't go
That's the trouble with a heartbreak
Yeah, that's the trouble with a heartbreak, a heartbreak, yeah

Think about where she is, who she's drivin' crazy (Drivin' me crazy)
Can't see a rearview sunset without thinkin' 'bout us
Girl, I still think about us

And that's the trouble with a heartbreak, it's gonna hang around
Leave you midnight breakin' down, wonderin' how
Long that it's gonna take gettin' over her
It's a can't drown, whiskey down, kinda hurt

But there ain't nowhere her memory can't go

Couldn't turn me off, yeah, even if you tried
So keep turnin' me on and turn out the lights
Who knows? Tonight, we might get it right

And the perfect smile

Say, ""It's not that hard""
But I just got a feeling
This will leave an ugly scar

If you say, ""She's nothing to worry about""
Then why'd you close your eyes when you said it out loud?

Stupid boy making me so sad
Didn't think you could change this fast
She's got everything that I don't have
How could I ever compete with that?
I know you'll go and change your mind
One day wake up and be bored with mine
She's got everything that I don't havе
And she's all I wanna be, all I wanna be so bad, so bad
Shе's got everything that I don't have, hm-mm

You want someone you can show off
Whenever you go out
She'll wear a tight mini black dress
With all her friends around
And then you'll probably spend the night at
Her nice big house
And by then I'll just be someone
You've forgotten about, oh

You and I
Had this off and on so long
You've been here, then you've been gone
So many times
And every night
Yeah, I'm always bumpin' into you
We do the same things we used to
It's your place or it's mine, so

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Well, I swear we're through with the lonely drunk and déjà vu
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Five minutes out of downtown
Ain't nothin' but a countdown

One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three shots of whiskey
Are you on your way?
Way tipsy, baby, come kiss me, I can't wait, I can't wait
Mississippi, two Mississippi, three in the mornin'
We'll be on our way
So tipsy, can't stop kissin', I can't wait, I can't wait forever

Mm, every time I'm at this bar, tap on the shoulder, turn around
And baby, there you are
And it's fire, you're like this Bourbon, hundred proof
Yeah, they don't burn the way you do
Yeah, we're better in the dark, so

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Well, I swear we're through with the lonely drunk and déjà vu
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Five minutes out of downtown
Ain't nothin' but a countdown

One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three shots of whiskey
Are you on your way?
Way tipsy, baby, come kiss me, I can't wait, I can't wait
Mississippi, two Mississippi, three in the mornin'
We'll be on our way
So tipsy, can't stop kissin', I can't wait, I can't wait forever

Hey

Kinda like that Georgia wind
We'll be gone and back again
But always wind up right back where we are
Playin' roulette with our hearts
And blowin' smoke rings in the dark, yeah

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Well, I swear we're through with the lonely drunk and déjà vu
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Five minutes out of downtown
Ain't nothin' but a countdown

One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three shots of whiskey
Are you on your way?
Way tipsy, baby, come kiss me, I can't wait, I can't wait

1099,Circles Around This Town,Maren Morris,"14 ContributorsCircles Around This Town Lyrics
I swear I don't know how I trusted
A Montero with the AC busted
A couple bad demos on a burned CD
Would take me all the way to Tennessee
I showed up to the new apartment
First month's, last month's, two deposits
Hadn't heard the sound of a door slam yet
Thank God I was an optimist

I drove circles around this town
Tryna write circles around this town
Tryin' to say somethin' with meanin'
Somethin' worth singin' about
I've been kind and I've been ruthless
Yeah, I got here, but the truth is
Thought when I hit it, it'd all look different
But I still got the pedal down
Drivin' circles around this town

So many times, I thought about lеavin'
Got my ass kicked tryin' to compete with
Evеrybody else's ones that got away
Hung around long enough to catch a break
A couple hundred songs and the ones that finally worked
Was the one about a car and the one about a church
That I wrote

Drivin' circles around this town
Tryna write circles around this town
Tryin' to say somethin' with meanin'
Somethin' worth singin' about
I've been kind and I've been ruthless
Yeah, I got here, but the truth is
Thought when I hit it, it'd all look different
But I still got the pedal down
Drivin' circles around this town
Drivin' circles around this town
Hey


I drove circles around this town
Tryna write circles around this town
Tryin' to say somethin' with meanin'
Somethin' worth singin' about
I've been kind and I've been ruthless
Yeah, I got here, but the truth is
Thought when I hit it, it'd all look different
But I still got the pedal down
I still get lost, I still get found
Drivin' circles around this town

Oh, yeah"

Last night, we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said, but we said it all
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But, baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet

No way it was our last night I kissed your lips
Make you grip the sheets with your fingertips
Last bottle of Jack, we split a fifth
Just talkin' 'bout life, goin' sip for sip
Yeah, you, you know you love to fight
And I say shit I don't mean
But I'm still gon' wake up wantin' you and me

I know that last night, we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said, but we said it all
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But, baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night (Last night)
No way it was our last night (Last night)

No way it was the last night that we break up
I see your tail lights in the dust
You call your mama, I call your bluff
In the middle of the night, pull it right back up
Yeah, my, my friends say, ""Let her go""
Your friends say, ""What the hell?""
I wouldn't trade your kind of love for nothin' else

Oh, baby, last night, we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said, but we said it all
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But, baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night, we said we'd had enough
I can't remember everything we said, but we said too much
I know you packed your shit and slammed the door right before you left
But, baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night (Last night)
No way it was our last night (Last night)

I know you said this time you really weren't comin' back again
But, baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night (Last night)
No way it was our last night (Last night)"

I can buy myself flowers

1103,Anti-Hero,Taylor Swift,"I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room

I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)

It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed

Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?
(A tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
(For the last time)

It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out
""She's laughing up at us from Hell""

It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi
Everybody agrees, everybody agrees

It's me, hi (Hi)
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime (Teatime), everybody agrees (Everybody agrees)

You got a fast car
And I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Startin' from zero, got nothin' to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothin' to prove

You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
Been workin' at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just across the bordеr and into the city
And you and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it means to bе livin'

See, my old man's got a problem
He live in the bottle, that's the way it is
He said his body's too old for workin'
His body's too young to look like his
So Mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, ""Somebody's gotta take care of him""
So I quit school and that's what I did

You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
Still gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way

So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
I, I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
We go cruisin', entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
So I work in the market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
And we'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house, live in the suburbs

So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
I, I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinkin' late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me'd find it
I got no plans, I ain't goin' nowhere
Take your fast car and keep on driving

So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
I, I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

Al centro della pista, è dove sarò
Non ho molto, ma è abbastanza per me, yeah

Perchè sto bene, sì, mi sento bene
Tesoro, avrò la miglior cazzo di notte della mia vita
E dovunque mi porti, sono pronta per il viaggio
Tesoro, non sai che sto bene, sì, mi sento bene

Sto bene
Bene
Sto bene
Non sai che sto bene, sì, mi sento bene

Quindi mi lascio andare, mi lascio andare
Oh, na-na-na-na-na
No, non mi importa più, importa più
Oh, na-na-na-na-na
Quindi, andiamo, fammelo sapere, fammelo sapere
Alzi le mani, na-na-na
No, tesoro, niente ci fermerà stanotte

Perchè sto bene, sì, mi sento bene
Tesoro, avrò la miglior cazzo di notte della mia vita
E dovunque mi porti, sono pronta per il viaggio
Tesoro, non sai che sto bene, sì, mi sento bene"

1112,Something in the Orange,Zach Bryan,"22 ContributorsSomething in the Orange Lyrics
It'll be fine by dusk light, I'm tellin' you, baby
These things eat at your bones and drive your young mind crazy
But when you place your head between my collar and jaw
I don't know much, but there's no weight at all

And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't
'Cause if I say I miss you, I know that you won't
But I miss you in the mornings when I see the sun
Somethin' in the orange tells me we're not done

To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home

I need to hear you say you've been waitin' all night
There's orange dancin' in your eyes from bulb light
Your voice only trembles when you try to speak
Take me back to us dancin', this wood used to creak

To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home

To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home
If you leave today, I'll just stare at the way
The orange touches all things around
The grass, trees, and dew, how I just hate you
Please turn those headlights around
Please turn those headlights around"

Yellow diamonds in the watch, this shit cost a lot
Never send a bitch your dot, that's how you get shot
I DM in Vanish Mode, I do that shit a lot
Took her pantiеs off and this bitch thicker than the plot
All my exеs ain't nothin', them hoes busted
If my opps ain't rappin', they ass duckin'
You ain't ready to pull the trigger, don't clutch it
I know you on your period baby, can you suck it?

Internet clones, got 'em kissin' through the phone
Pussies cliquin' up so they don't feel alone, ayy
Man nigga seein' me, I'm Young Money CMB
I used to roll with CMG, the house is not a BNB
The bad bitches waitin' on a nigga like I'm PND
I'm steady pushin' P, you niggas pushing PTSD
I told her ass to kiss me in the club, fuck a TMZ
I used to want a GMC, when Woe was doing BNE
We revvin' up and goin' on a run like we DMC
I layup with her for a couple days, then its BRB
You rappers love askin' if I fucked, when you know we did
When you know we did
She came in heels but she left out on her cozy shit
Ayy, I'm livin every twenty-four like Kobe did
Shoutout to the 6ix, R.I.P to 8
Swear this shit is gettin' ate, I'm on ten for the cake
Get a lot of love from twelve, but I don't reciprocate
Fifty-one division stay patrollin' when it's late
21 my addy, so my knife is on the gate
All my dawgs eatin' off a Baccarat plate

Why are you sitting at home on the floor?
What kind of pills are you on?""
Ringin' the bell
And nobody's coming to help
Your daddy lives by himself
He just wants to know that you're well, oh-oh-oh

In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same

Go home, get ahead, light-speed internet
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was

I don't wanna talk about who's doin' it first

You know it's not the same as it was

We've been swingin’ and missin'
It ain't broke yet, but damn, it needs fixin’
Been a while since your kiss felt like kissin'
It's just different

We've been talkin' 'bout forever since we been together
Somethin' 'bout a ring makes you think we’re better
Off with all this, but we’re caught in-between

A rock and a hard place
Red wine and mistakes
Tears rollin' down your face
When I walked out that door
That’s when I lost it
Midnight in Austin
Damn, I'm exhausted
What the hell's this all for?
Is this where it mеnds or it breaks?
Between a rock and a hard place

For thе record (Shit)
Throwin' in the towel takes some effort
So I’d rather ride it out for better weather
Together

Between a rock and a hard place
Red wine and mistakes
Tears rollin' down your face
When I walked out that door
That's when I lost it
Midnight in Austin
Damn, I'm exhausted
What the hell's this all for?
Is this where it mends or it breaks?
Between a rock and a hard place

We've been talkin' 'bout forever since we been together
Somethin' 'bout a ring makes you think we're better
Off with all this, but we're caught in-between

A rock and a hard place
Tears rollin' down your face
As I walked out that door
That's when I lost it
Midnight in Austin
Damn, I'm exhausted
What the hell's this all for?
Is this where it mends or it breaks?
How much more of this can we take?"

Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)

How's everything back at home?
Yеah, how's that garden comin'? Is Dad still doin' dumb shit?
And how'd he keep you this long?

Made a change to evеrything from my heart to my last name, hey
Hard to tеll, when he fell, that boy was Heaven sent
And every night when I close my eyes, before I say ""Amen""

I thank God I get to wake up by your side
And thank God your hand fits perfectly in mine
And thank God you loved me when you didn't have to
But you did, and you do, and He knew
Thank God for giving me you
Thank God, thank God, yeah, yeah
Thank God, ooh-ooh

Hand on the Bible
Don't know how I got you
I couldn't ask for more
Girl, what we got's worth thanking God for

So thank God I get to wake up by your side
And thank God your hand fits perfectly in mine
And thank God you loved me when you didn't have to
But you did, and you do, and He knew
Thank God for giving me you
Thank God, thank God
Thank God, yeah, yeah, thank God
Thank God for giving me you
Thank God (Ooh), yeah, thank God (Oh)
Thank God
Thank God for giving me you"

Love you like a brother

I decided I had to finish
But the media called me a menace
I done sat with the mayor and politicians, I'm tryna change the image
You can't blame my past no more, I come from the trenches
Some said I'd never be a superstar, but I know I'm different (No, no, no)
I'm The Voice, but the system ain't give me a choice
Know some people that's still unemployed
I know a felon who tryna get FOID
Child support your only support
For a visit, I'm goin' through courts
Went to jail, they was chainin' me up
And you know that I'm famous as fuck
See, how you gon' joke about stimulus?
But they really had came in the clutch
I know some kids wanna hurt theyself
Stop tryna take drugs, I refer to myself
Tryna better myself, tryna better my health but

First-generation ghetto nigga
Cole world, hello niggas
Made it out the city with my head on straight
Niggas keep shootin' up the lead out
Young Jordan Peele, gotta get out
And the shit that I spit out
Is a cheat code like I'm facin' a RICO
And how a nigga put a hit out
And another one, and, and another one
I got like a hundred of 'em
'Bout to lap niggas so they think they ahead of me
But I'm really in front of them
Now some of them fumblin' they bags
Fuckin' up the little crumbs that they had
A reminder to humble yourself
This shit could be gone in an instant
Me, I'm runnin' long distance, all pistons firin'
I been stuck between maybe retirin'
And feelin' like I'm just not hittin' my prime
These days seein' rappers be dyin'
Way before they even gettin' they shine
I never even heard of lil' buddy
'Til somebody murdered lil' buddy
Now I'm on the phone, searchin' lil' buddy name
Got to playin' his tunes
All day in my room, thinkin', ""Damn
This shit wicked, to get they names buzzin'
Some niggas just gotta go lay in a tomb""
And media thirsty for clicks
I got a new rule
If you ain't never posted a rapper when he was alive
You can't post about him after he get hit
It's simple, it's the principle
On any tempo, I'm invincible
Don't even rap, I just vent to you
I rather that than an interview most days
Fuck 'em all like I'm goin' through a ho phase
Young nigga shoot out the whip like road rage
I pray all of my dawgs stay so paid
And the only thing that kill 'em is old age

All my life (All my life)
They been tryin' to keep me down (They been tryna keep me down)
All this time (All this time)
Never thought I would make it out (Never thought I'd make it out)
They couldn't break me, they couldn't break me (No, no)
They couldn't take me, they couldn't take me (No)

Mate, what do you think of that girl?
The one dancing alone, I like her for myself
Beautiful, she knows she's hot
Everyone's watching her dance
I approach her and lay on the charm
We drink without reservations, just temptation
I told her, ""I'm going to win over your family, and in a few days you'll be mine""
She said I'm crazy, but she likes that
No guy acts like me

Here you go, sweetheart
And all double P, man
Just like that, my buddy Pedro
All Eslabon Armado
For the young ladies
Cha-chau!

I'm not a guy with money
But when it comes to the heart, I fulfill everything for you
I held her hand tightly
My friend couldn't believe it, as I passed by
Her body, I swear to God, was so perfect
Her waist like a model's
Her eyes captivated me from the start
She liked me, and I like her"
1126,Karma,Taylor Swift,"You're talking shit for the hell of it
Addicted to betrayal, but you're relevant
You're terrified to look down
'Cause if you dare, you'll see the glare
Of everyone you burned just to get there
It's coming back around

And I keep my side of the street clean
You wouldn't know what I mean

'Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that

Spiderboy, king of thieves
Weave your little webs of opacity
My pennies made your crown
Trick me once, trick me twice
Don't you know that cash ain't the only price?
It's coming back around

And I keep my side of the street clean
You wouldn't know what I mean

'Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that

Ask me what I learned from all those years
Ask me what I earned from all those tears
Ask me why so many fade, but I'm still here
(I'm still here, I'm still here)

'Cause karma is the thunder
Rattling your ground
Karma's on your scent like a bounty hunter
Karma's gonna track you down
Step by step, from town to town
Sweet like justice, karma is a queen
Karma takes all my friends to the summit
Karma is the guy on the screen
Coming straight home to me

'Cause karma is my boyfriend (Karma is my boyfriend)
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend (Weekend)
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat

1129,Vampire,Olivia Rodrigo,"Hate to give the satisfaction asking how you're doing now
How's the castle built off people you pretend to care about?
Just what you wanted
Look at you, cool guy, you got it
I see the parties and the diamonds sometimes when I close my eyes
Six months of torture you sold as some forbidden paradise
I loved you truly
You gotta laugh at the stupidity

'Cause I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange
You only come out at night
I used to think I was smart
But you made me look so naive
The way you sold me for parts
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
Bloodsucker, fame fucker
Bleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire
And every girl I ever talked to told me you were bad, bad news
You called them crazy, God, I hate the way I called 'em crazy too
You're so convincing
How do you lie without flinching? (How do you lie? How do you lie? How do you lie?)
Oh, what a mesmerizing, paralyzing, fucked up little thrill
Can't figure out just how you do it and God knows I never will
Went for me and not her
'Cause girls your age know better

I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange
You only come out at night
I used to think I was smart
But you made me look so naive
The way you sold me for parts
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
Bloodsucker, fame fucker
Bleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire
(Ah)
You said it was true love, but wouldn't that be hard?
You can't love anyone 'cause that would mean you had a heart
I tried to help you out, now I know that I can't
'Cause how you think's the kind of thing I'll never understand

I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange
You only come out at night
I used to think I was smart
But you made me look so naive
The way you sold me for parts

I only talk to God when I need a favor
And I only pray when I ain't got a prayer

If I only talk to God when I need a favor?

I know amazin' grace, but I ain't been livin' them words
Swear I spend most Sundays
Drunk off my ass than I have at church
Hard cover King James
Only been savin' dust on the nightstand
And I don't know what to say
By the time I fold my hands

I only talk to God when I need a favor
And I only pray when I ain't got a prayer
So who the hell am I, who the hell am I to expect a savior, oh
If I only talk to God when I need a favor?
But, God, I need a favor

Amen, amen

Yeah, I owe you more than one
And beggars can't be choosers
But I'll pay for all I've done
Just pleasе don't let me lose hеr

I only talk to God when I need a favor
And I only pray when I ain't got a prayer
So who the hell am I, who the hell am I to expect a savior, oh

And I only pray when I ain't got a prayer
So tell me, who the hell am I to expect a savior
When I only talk to God if I need a favor?
And, God, I need a favor

Amen

When the night's here, I don't do tears
Baby, no chance

I could dance, I could dance, I could dance

Watch me dance, dance the night away
My heart could be burnin', but you won't see it on my face
Watch me dance, dance the night away (Uh-huh)
I'll still keep the party runnin', not one hair out of place

When my heart breaks (They never see it, never see it)
When my world shakes (I feel alive, I feel alive)
I don't play safe (Ooh), don't you know about me? (Uh-huh)
I could dance, I could dance, I could dance

Even when the tears are flowin', they're diamonds on my face
I'll still keep the party goin', not one hair out of place (Yes, I can)

Dance the night"
1135,Love You Anyway,Luke Combs,"14 ContributorsLove You Anyway Lyrics
If your kiss turned me to stone
I'd be a statue standing tall in ancient Rome
And if your touch shattered me like glass
I’d be in pieces trying to make the breaking last

If it took one look to turn my days to night
At least I'd have the stars that sparkle in your eyes

There's just some things that leave a man no choice
Like a compass needle needing its true North
Even if I knew the day we met you’d be the reason this heart breaks
Oh, I'd love you anyway

I know just tryin' to write a song
I run the risk that I could get your perfect wrong
And well, I guess what I'm tryin' to say
Is there ain't words been made could shoulder so much weight

And if you turned your back on me and walked away
Not a thing about the way I feel would change

There's just some things that leave a man no choice
Like a compass needle needing its true North
Even if I knew the day we met you'd be the reason this heart breaks
Oh, I’d love you anyway


There’s just some things that leave a man no choice
Like a compass needle needing its true North
Even if I knew the day we met you'd be the reason this heart breaks
Oh, I’d love you anyway

Even if I knew the day we met you'd be the reason this heart breaks
Oh, I'd love you anyway"

Somebody hand me a cigarette
I know I ain't had one in over a week
Somebody pour me a double shot
Been gettin' better by the day, but tonight I drink

You say I gotta get over you and get sober too
I got a lot of habits I gotta kick
But weigh out all your options and take your pick

I can either burn the bar down
Or I can take your number out my phone
I can give you up right now
And never want you back long as I'm half-stoned
If you want me to quit you, want me to get you
Outta my heart and, baby, off my mind
I hate to tell you, girl, but I'm only quittin' one thing at a time

I know I got me some problems
About a thousand memories I gotta forgеt
But if I'm gonna solve 'em
Baby, I'll take all thе help I can get

If you ain't gonna kiss me
Then I'll take some whiskey, some Grizzly
Nicotine amphetamines too
You want me to stop some of that
Or you want me to stop lovin' you?
Hey, what you want me to do?

I can either burn the bar down
Or I can take your number out my phone
I can give you up right now
And never want you back long as I'm half-stoned
If you want me to quit you, want me to get you
Outta my heart and, baby, off my mind
I hate to tell you, girl, but I'm only quittin' one thing at a time

Aw, yeah, I hate to tell you
Aw, yeah, I hate to tell you

I ain't no Superman, I'm just the way I am
If I'm gonna move on, then I need me somethin' in my hand
Ain't nothin' wrong with that
And if you ain't comin' back

I can either burn the bar down
Or I can take your number out my phone
I can give you up right now
And never want you back long as I'm half-stoned
If you want me to quit you, want me to get you
Outta my heart and, baby, off my mind
I hate to tell you, girl, but I'm only quittin' one thing at a time

Zenci zengin olsun, savaşa götürsen iyi olur

Kötü bir şey mi yapıyorsun, seni bir tek döverim

Somunla ekmek, motora turbo
Tic-Tac-Toe, başka bir akbaba öldür
Onlara torbalarca mal satıyorum, sürtük yoga yapıyor
Bir ödülü hak ediyorum, bu kayalara hizmet ediyorum
Alışveriş yaptığımda yüz bin büyük, toplam bu
Garajı doldur kaltak, ben bir kralım
Cephe yok, fugazi yok

Let loose, crazy, then get soaked
Get wet from my body, you know, in the Benz, get in
What's up? My baby in the Mercedes-Benz
The stars on the ceiling, stellar has already left
But you know that this night you're for me
Come, climb on top of me, send me your location, I'll pick you up

She wants me to play music for her
So the baby dances all the way down
We drank a couple bottles
And still, she remembers that we did it yestеrday
She wants me to play music for her
So thе babe dances all the way down
We drank a couple bottles
And still, she remembers that we did it yesterday

She has not yet forgotten how we spent time
We went to the club and the two of us danced close together
Like dogs close together, kisses and a couple drinks
She stayed by my side and said, ""I think I fell in love""
She smokes, she drinks
She's a little devil, small, but spicy
I love it when she rubs it against my pants
She loves it, you can see it in her face, she enjoys it

She's got a boyfriend and doesn't behave
She tells me, ""Chill, 'cause the relationship is broken""
Our bodies crash and crash
Our mouths get together, the leggings choke her

She wants me to play music for her
So the babe dances all the way down
We drank a couple bottles
And still, she remembers that we did it yesterday
She wants me to play music for her
So the babe dances all the way down
We drank a couple bottles
And still, she remembers that we did it yesterday

Yesterday, yesterday you were moving very well, very well
She got covered in the smell of Chanel
We're a thousand degrees Fahrenheit
She's hot and has a pretty face
You play music for her, and she gets horny by herself
For the party, she never holds back
A couple friends, she completes the crew
But you, mama, you know, I like you a lot
Crazy, come here, get close all the way back
You and me will go on a fleeting journey
Interstellar, eat you out
We will both smoke marijuana
In my room, on my rooftop and on my bed
Bae, I think you're getting a call, answer tomorrow
Don't let the fire die
On the AMG, listening to ""Ruedas y Cristal""
Burning poison that got me flying, mami
A little kiss to the Barbie, so she dances close
Slanty eyes like Puki from Taiwan, -an
Like Puki from Taiwan
Like Puki from Taiwan
I eat that pussy whenever I want, mami, mami

Let loose, crazy, then get soaked (Baby, all the way down)
Get wet from my body, you know, in the Benz, get in (Baby, all the way down)
What's up? My baby in the Mercedes-Benz (Baby, all the way down)
The stars on the ceiling, stellar one has already left (Eh)

Oh, she wants me to play music for her
So the babe dances all the way down
We drank a couple bottles
And still, she remembers that we did it yesterday
She wants me to play music for her
So the babe dances all the way down
We drank a couple bottles
And still, she remembers that we did it yesterday

Today is the night to be single
She likes twerking and dancing close to you

Pink and orange skies, feelin' super childish, no Donald Glover
Missed call from my mother
Like, ""Where you at tonight?""
Got no alibi

I was all alone with the love of my life
She's got glitter for skin
My radiant beam in the night
I don't need no light to see you

Shine
It's your golden hour (Oh)
You slow down time
In your golden hour (Oh)

We were just two lovers
Feet up on the dash, drivin' nowhere fast burnin' through the summer
Radio on blast, make the moment last, she got solar power
Minutes feel like hours
She knew she was the baddest
Can you even imagine fallin' like I did

For the love of my life?
She's got glow on her face
A glorious look in her eyes
My angel of light
I was all alone with the love of my life
She's got glitter for skin
My radiant beam in the night (Ah)

I went lookin' at pictures I didn't wanna see
They brought back memories
You look happy, I guess, got the life that you wanted
But it ain't with me
You would think by now that I wouldn't care
It's been a couple years and, yeah, I've had my share
Of other broken-up hearts, but I only shed real tears over ours

And now I'm in this cold bright light
And this don't even feel like life
'Cause I don't have the only woman who believed in me

And now I'm in the back of the church
Prayin' just to stop the hurt
'Cause I don't have the only woman who was there for me
Religiously

Remember watchin' you play me our song on guitar
I thought I'd marry you
Act like I'm happier now, but all of my friends know
That ain't the truth
And lately life's been good to me
Mama's healthy and I'm helpin' out the whole family
Lotta people know my name, I made a little change
But that don't mean nothin'

'Cause now I'm in this cold bright light
And this don't even feel like life
'Cause I don't have the only woman who believed in me

And now I'm in the back of the church
Prayin' hard just to stop the hurt
'Cause I don't have the only woman who was there for me

You brought me to God and I put you through hell
You were all about us, I was all about myself
What kind of man would lose a woman like that?
If my soul could be forgiven, I would give it all back

Now I'm in this cold bright light
And this don't even feel like life
'Cause I don't have the only woman who believed in me

And now I'm in the back of the church
Beggin' God just to stop the hurt

Você tem que sentir essa merda, cara

Woah

Eu tenho sentimentos por você
Espero que você não esteja amando a minha tropa
Com quantos você já ficou?
Rezo pra que não sejam mais do que alguns
Sei que você lidou com alguns otários
Quando você era jovem e tava na escola
Ele teve que tirar sua virgindade
Mas eu te deixei molhada como uma piscina
Ela tem um G-Wag' novo
Ela quer ir no Highlight Room e exibi-lo
Tá com um corpo novo, garota, mostra isso aí
É Brasileira, eu sei que é mole
Tonificada e ela tem um pacote de seis
Parece que ela costumava jogar vôlei
American Express, você pode ter tudo
Código para o cofre, você pode ter tudo isso
Foda-se a sua página principal, qual é o seu Finsta? Eu quero conhecer a verdadeira você
Você começou a dançar pra pagar sua mensalidade, garota, eu quero saber pelo que você passou
Você quer uma boutique ou quer vender cabelo, apenas me diga do que você gosta
Se você estiver em público e ele quiser seu número, apenas diga pra ele, ""Meu namorado vai te matar""

A maneira como você faz me sentir hoje em dia
Algo tá caindo pra você, garota
Atiro na cabeça de um cara pra você, garota
Queimo alguém pra você
A maneira como você faz me sentir hoje em dia
Saio do meu corpo pra você, garota
Acabo com ele como se ele fosse arrogante com você, garota
Saio do meu corpo pra você

Caramba, acabei de ligar no noticiário e vi que os caras que nunca conseguiram buceta na escola
Estão fazendo leis sobre o que as mulheres podem fazer
Eu tenho que te proteger, eu sou rico, com laços, desde sempre, baby
Por isso eu tenho que te respeitar
Esses caras colocaram as mãos em você no passado, inseguros porque seu corpo é precioso
Quatro palavras quando penso nelas são crocante, mofado, empoeirado, enferrujado
Oito palavras quando penso na gente é vamos transar, vamos transar, vamos transar, vamos transar
Se te desrespeitarem, eu vou acabar com eles
As mensagens que você manda nas legendas
Os vídeos que vazamos, ficamos virais ou ganhamos platina
Não se preocupe com a história da sua amiga quando eu tava com ela sozinho
Ela vai tentar acrescentar coisas nisso, te tirar da sua zona
Você sabe como é quando eles não conseguem uma reserva no Carbone
Eles vão te dizer que é uma noite fria, te dizer como eles preferem ficar em casa, yeah
Vadias ciumentas, yeah
E eu sei o que eu disse sobre estar na Vogue
Mas assim como aquele grupo de R&B dos anos 90
Garota, é só uma ligação e eu vou te colocar na Vogue
Uma ligação e você vai estar nos desfiles
Uma ligação e vou estar sentado na primeira fileira
Uma ligação errada do seu ex dizendo besteira e isso vai fazer com que ele seja mandado pra casa
Uma ligação e os meus manos topam na hora
Topam ir aonde eu disser pra ir
Mesmo se tivermos que viajar pelo mundo
Topam te levar pro fim da estrada, de verdade

A maneira como você faz me sentir hoje em dia
Algo tá caindo pra você, garota
Atiro na cabeça de um cara pra você, garota
Queimo alguém pra você
A maneira como você faz me sentir hoje em dia
Saio do meu corpo pra você, garota
Acabo com ele como se ele fosse arrogante com você, garota
Saio do meu corpo pra você

Oh, o seu amor é tão profundo (Sentimento tão profundo)
Quero você, eu quero-quero você
Me dê o seu amor (Sentimento tão profundo)"

1146,Next Thing You Know,Jordan Davis,"10 ContributorsNext Thing You Know Lyrics
You swear that you're stayin' single, next thing you know
You meet a girl at a bar and next thing you know
You get her laughin', it's 2AM
You're tellin' your buddies, three months in
That she ain't movin' in, the next thing you know
There's a U-Haul trailer, the next thing you know
Your old apartment, is y'all's new place
There goes the carpet but the deer head stays

Next thing you know
You're savin' money like never before, just to
Spend it all at a jewelry store
Gettin' down on one knee on hеr mama's porch
Just prayin' she don't say, ""No""
Next thing you know
Your best man givеs a half-drunk speech and you're
Sunburnt on a honeymoon beach and your
Left hand's gettin' used to that ring
And there the next two or three years go
Next thing you know

You weren't really tryin', next thing you know
There's a test on the counter, next thing you know
She's standin' there cryin', noddin' her head yes
You're half excited, half scared to death

'Cause next thing you know
You're wearin' scrubs and a funny white hat and the
Doctor's sayin', how you doin' there dad and
Nobody's ever called you that
And you take that drive home slow
Next thing you know
It's first steps, first dates, first car
It's 11:01 wonderin' where they are
You're sayin' that USC's too far
It's amazing how fast seventeen years go
Next thing you know
Next thing you know

Next thing you know
You get to know your wife again and you're
More in love than you've ever been
With a lot of years of remember when's and still some down the road

'Cause next thing you know
You got a yard full of your kid's kids
And you take 'em to church, teach 'em to fish
And you, tell 'em stories every chance you get
About how fast this life down here can go
Next thing you know
(Next thing you know, ooh)
Next thing you know
(Next thing you know, ooh)"
1147,Escapism,Raye,"Sleazin' and teasin', I'm sittin' on him
All of my diamonds are drippin' on him
I met him at the bar, it was twelve or something
I ordered two more wines 'cause tonight, I want him

A little context if you care to listen
I find myself in a shit position
The man that I love sat me down last night
And he told me that it's over, dumb decision
And I don't wanna feel how my heart is rippin'
In fact, I don't wanna feel, so I stick to sippin'
And I'm out on the town with a simple mission
In my little black dress and this shit is sittin'

Just a heart broke bitch, high heels six inch
In the back of the nightclub, sippin' champagne
I don't trust any of these bitches I'm with
In the back of the taxi sniffin' cocaine
Drunk calls, drunk texts, drunk tears, drunk sex
I was lookin' for a man who was on the same page
Now it's back to the intro, back to the bar
To the Bentley, to the hotel, to my old ways

'Cause I don't wanna feel how I did last night
I don't wanna feel how I did last night
Doctor, doctor, anything, please
Doctor, doctor, have mercy on me
Take this pain away
You're askin' me my symptoms, doctor, I don't wanna feel

Toke this joint how I'm blowin' this steam
Back to my ways like 2019
Not twenty-four hours since my ex did dead it
I got a new man on me, it's about to get sweaty
Last night really was the cherry on the cake
Been some dark days lately and I'm findin' it cripplin'
Excuse my state, I'm as high as your hopes
That you'll make it to my bed, get me hot and sizzlin'
If I take a step back to see the glass half-full
At least it's the Prada two-piece that I'm trippin' in
And I'm already actin' like a dick, know what I mean?
So you might as well stick it in (What?)

Just a heart broke bitch, high heels six inch
In the back of the nightclub, sippin' champagne
I don't trust any of these bitches I'm with
In the back of the taxi sniffin' cocaine
Drunk calls, drunk texts, drunk tears, drunk sex
I was lookin' for a man who was on the same page
Now it's back to the intro, back to the bar
To the Bentley, to the hotel, to my old ways

'Cause I don't wanna feel how I did last night
I don't wanna feel how I did last night
Doctor, doctor, anything, please
Doctor, doctor, have mercy on me
Take this pain away
You're askin' me my symptoms, doctor, I don't wanna feel, mm (What?)

'Cause I don't wanna feel like I felt last night
I don't wanna feel like I felt last night
Be at peace with the things you can't change (Last night)
I'll be naked when I leave and I was naked when I came, yeah
Out of reach, out of touch
Too numb, I don't feel no way
Toast up, so what?
Street small, but it go both ways
So, you'll run, yeah
But you'll never escape
Sunset in the maze
(You're askin' me my symptoms, doctor, I don't wanna feel)

I don't wanna feel how I did last night
I don't wanna feel how I did last night, oh
Doctor, doctor, anything, please
Doctor, doctor, have mercy on me
You're askin' me my symptoms, doctor, I don't wanna feel

I don't wanna feel how I did last night
I don't wanna feel how I did last night
How I did, how I did, how I did last night

Mm, lipstick smudged like modern art
I don't know where the fuck I am or who's drivin' the fuckin' car
Speedin' down the highway, sippin'
Mixin' pills with the liquor cah fuck these feelings
I left everyone I love on read (Uh-huh)
Spilling secrets to the stranger in my bed (Uh-huh)
I remember nothing so there's nothing to regret (Uh-uh)
Other than this 4/4 kick drum poundin' in my head (Mm)"

I have 1% left
And I'll use it just to tell you how sorry I am
If they see me with someone else at a disco, it's just wasting time
Baby, why would I lie to you?
If they say they saw me happy, no, no, it ain't true

Nothing makes me laugh anymore
Only when I see the pictures and videos I have of you
I went out with someone else to forget you
And I had the perfume that you like
I light up to go to sleep
Because I sleep better if I dream that you're here
If you knеw that I wrote you
I haven't sent thе messages, they're all still there
Wow, how much its cost me
Maybe I did you a favor when I left your side
Drunk looking at your pictures, it hurts me to see that you did get better
You don't have grey days, your scars don't hurt anymore
And I'm wondering if I should tell you that

I have 1% left
And I'll use it just to tell you how sorry I am
If they see me with someone else at a disco, it's just wasting time
Baby, why would I lie to you?
If they say they saw me happy, no, no, it ain't true (Ayy)

It's been while since I thought about you
Drunk on your Insta, I logged in
Baby, I already know that you're doing good
That you don't want to know about me, ayy, ayy
Living in an inferno and I set myself on fire
Playing with you like I'm number ten
I feel like I'm no longer in your heart, now I'm at your feet
Begging for you, drowning myself in the tequila
The boys are asking me out
I'm having a good time, but I always end up missing you
Drowning myself in the tequila, ayy
These young women texting me, ayy
Where are we getting wasted today, but

I have 1% left
And I'll use it just to tell you how sorry I am
If they see me with someone else at a disco, it's just wasting time
Baby, why would I lie to you?
If they say they see me happy, no, it ain't true

And this is Grupo Frontera

1153,Wait in the Truck,Hardy,"18 Contributors​wait in the truck Lyrics
I got turned around in some little town
I'd never been to before
Workin' my way through a middle of June
Midnight thunderstorm
There was somethin' in the headlights
That stopped me on a dime
Well, she was scared to death
So I said, ""Climb in,"" and in she climbed
Oh, yeah

Well, she was bruised and broke from head to toe
With a tear in her blood-stained shirt
She didn't tell the whole truth, but she didn't have to
I knew what had happenеd to her
I didn't load her down with questions
That girl had been through еnough
I just threw it in drive, looked in those eyes
And asked her where he was

I don't know if he's an angel
'Cause angels don't do what he did
He was hellbent to find the man behind
All the whiskey scars I hid
I never thought my day of justice
Would come from a judge under his seat
But I knew right then I'd never get hit again when he said to me
""Wait in the truck
Just wait in the truck""

Well, I knocked and knocked and no one came
So I kicked in his double-wide door
I let the hammer drop before he got
To that 12 he was reachin' for
I didn't try to hide my pistol
I didn't even try to run
I just sat on the porch, smokin' one of his cigarettes
And waited for the cops to come

I don't know if he's an angel
'Cause angels don't do what he did
He was hellbent to find the man behind
All the whiskey scars I hid
I never thought my day of justice
Would come from a judge under his seat
But I knew right then I'd never get hit again when he said to me
""Wait in the truck
Just wait in the truck""

Whoa (Oh)
Have mercy on me, Lord
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on me, Lord (Oh)

It's been sixty months and she still comes
To see me from time to time
It was worth the price to see a brighter side
Of the girl I picked up that night
And I might be here forever
It ain't paradise, that's true
But it's a whole hell of a lot better
Than the place I sent him to
Yeah

(Have mercy, have mercy, have mercy on me)
""Wait in the truck, just wait in the truck""

(Have mercy, have mercy, have mercy on me)
""Wait in the truck, just wait in the truck""

Hangin' out my Silverado down a road I love to ride

Wish I woulda known that by now you'd be good and gone
And you'd leave us in a cloud of dust
Can't you see what you're doin', girl?
You ruined damn near everything I love

I don't care how much they're bitin', I won't even crank the boat
Soon as that bobber hits thе water, girl, your memory starts to float
Baby, why'd l evеr take the bait and take you places that I love to go?
Hell, I'll never know

I even took you to my hometown to meet my mama
Now I'm gonna see you every time I see that welcome sign

Wish I woulda known that by now you'd be good and gone
And you'd leave us in a cloud of dust
Can't you see what you're doin', girl?
You ruined damn near everything I love


I don't wanna hear ""one more silver dollar""
I can't take my Silverado down them roads we used to ride

Wish I woulda known that by now you'd be good and gone
And you'd leave us in a cloud of dust
Can't you see what you're doin', girl?
You ruined damn near everything I love
I can't go nowhere near the whiskey 'cause you used to drink it with me

It's got a lead foot down when it's leavin'
Lord knows it's taken a hell of a beatin'
A little bit of love is all that it's needin'
But it's good as it is tough
I got a heart like a truck

Go on and see if you can knock off the dust, yeah
Shine it up, rev it up, and let it run, yeah
It gets a high ridin' off into the sun, yeah
It gets a high ridin' off into the sun"
1158,"Going, Going, Gone",Luke Combs,"10 ContributorsGoing, Going, Gone Lyrics
Some things in life are meant to fly
And others, they were born to run
You can't tie them up and leave 'em
Like the changing of the seasons
Good things, they come and then they go

Like a runaway Southbound train
Like an Arizona desert rain
Like lightning in the sky
Like fireworks in July
Like a left field home run ball
Like a whiskey shot at last call
It's like she was made for moving on
That girl is going, going, gone

I can say it wasn't meant to be
But maybe meant to be is misunderstood
I can't hold on to letting go
Change the way the river flows
Lovin' her's like roping in the wind

Like a runaway Southbound train
Like an Arizona desert rain
Like lightning in the sky
Like fireworks in July
Like a left field homerun ball
Like a whiskey shot at last call
It's like she was made for moving on
That girl is going, going, gone


She ain't got one bit of stick around
There's no sense in tryin' to slow her down

Like a runaway Southbound train
Like an Arizona desert rain
Like lightning in the sky
Like fireworks in July
Like a left field homerun ball
Like a whiskey shot at last call
It's like she was made for moving on
That girl is going, going, gone

Going, going, gone
Going, going, gone"

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Every couple tries to stop
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later, we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling

You will get a sentimental feeling
When you hear
Voices singing, ""Let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly""

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancin' merrily
In the new old-fashioned way

The girl that said a void can be filled with somebody else is lying to you
It's like covering a wound with makeup, you don't see it, but you still feel it
You left, saying you were over me (Ayy) and you got a new girlfriend
What she doesn't know is you (Auh) still watch all of my stories (No, papi)

Baby, what happened? Weren't you doing well? (—ell)
Why are you looking for me? You know I don't make any mistakes twice (Ayy, papi)
Tell your new baby, that I don't compete for men
That she should stop hating, 'cause at least I kept you looking cute

Seeing you with the new one hurt (Hurt)
But I'm already ready for my own thing
I forgot everything that we lived
And that's what got you so offended
Even my life got better
You're no longer welcome here
I saw what your girlfriend said about me
I'm not even upset, I laugh, I laugh

I don't have time for whomever can't contribute, I changed directions
Making money as if it was a sport (Ah)
Filling up my account, concerts, the parking, and my passport (Ayy)
And reports are saying I look hotter (Yes)
Now you wanna come back, I can tell, mmm, yeah
Keep waiting for me, 'cause I'm an idiot (Ah)
You forgot I'm doing my thing
And that La Bichota was too good for you

Baby, what happened? (Happened) Weren't you doing well? (Ah)
Why are you looking for me? (Ayy) You know I don't make any mistakes twice (Ayy, papi)
Tell your new baby that I don't compete for men
That she should stop hating, 'cause at least I kept you looking cute (Shakira, Shakira)

You left and I got triple M
More hot, more toned, more chill
Go back to you, never, you were bad luck
Because now blessings rain down on me
And you want to come back, I saw it coming
Liking my photo
You were looking for food on the outside
And I used to say it was the monotony
And now you want to come back, I saw it coming
Liking my photo (Mine)
You look happy with your new life, but
If only she knew you still look for me

Baby, what happened? (Happened), weren't you doing great? (Ah)
Why are you looking for me? (Ayy) You know I don't make any mistakes twice
Tell your new baby that I don't compete for men (Shake that ass)
That she doesn't have a good hand, and at least I kept you looking cute

And I can't see from afar, baby

Don't you tell Daddy, he'll blow a fuse
Don't worry, I'm doin' okay
I know you raised me to know right from wrong
It ain't what you think and I'm still writin' songs
Just never thought I'd see the day
I've never felt this way

I met somebody and he's got blue eyes
He opens the door and he don't make me cry
He ain't from where we're from, but he feels like home, yeah
He's got me doin' things I've never done
In Georgia, they'd call it a sin
I'm wearin' Tennessee orange for him

Took me to Knoxville last Saturday
And I wore the hat on his dash to the game
It sure wasn't Athens, but I
Fell for him under those Neyland lights

I met somebody and he's got blue eyes
He opens the door and he don't make me cry
He ain't from where we're from, but he feels like home, yeah
He's got me doin' things I've never done
In Georgia, they'd call it a sin
I'm wearin' Tennessee orange for him

Mama, forgive me, I like him a lot
Hell, I'm learnin' the words to ""Old Rocky Top""
He's got a smile that makes me forget
I've always looked better in red

But I met somebody and he's got blue eyes
He opens the door and he don't make me cry
He ain't from where we're from, but he feels like home, yeah
He's got me doin' things I've never done
I met somebody and he's got blue eyes
He opens the door and he don't make me cry
He ain't from where we're from, but he feels like home, yeah

And I still want the Dawgs to win

Сучки липнут ко мне, потому что видят много бабла (Чёрт)
Говорят за спиной, не обращаю внимания
Зарабатываю много, точно знаю, кто я такая (Грра)
Хочу быть тихоней, но чел написывает мне в Инсте (Грра)
Если хватит ума, то будет вести себя, как фанат (Чёрт)

Поэтому он набил себе моё имя
Но я не пускаю его к себе в дом (Грра)
Поэтому занимаемся этим в других местах (Грра)
Нынче я стараюсь избегать этих камер
Им нравится то, что моё лицо на всех этих баннерах
Звонят мне на мобильный, хотя знают, что я не отвечу (Почему?)
На районе я как принцесса Диана (Грра)
У меня упругие формы, потому что ем овсяную кашу (Ха)
Сучкам я не дам ничего, кроме примера
Она хочет быть мной — и трясёт своей жопой
Моё имя на её языке, поэтому она захлебнётся (Сучка)
Для её парня я девушка мечты
Он думает обо мне, даже когда чистит зубы
Пишет мне, я посмотрю, но не отвечу
Самая горячая сучка здесь и они это знают (Они это знают)

Типа, грра, давай без обмана

1173,I Remember Everything,Zach Bryan,"35 ContributorsTranslationsDeutschPortuguêsNorsk日本語 (Japanese)EspañolI Remember Everything Lyrics
Rotgut whiskey's gonna ease my mind
Beach towel rests on the dryin' line
Do I remind you of your daddy in his '88 Ford?
Labrador hangin' out the passenger door
The sand from your hair is blowin' in my eyes
Blame it on the beach, grown men don't cry
Do you remember that beat-down basement couch?
I'd sing you my love songs and you'd tell me about
How your mama ran off and pawned her ring
I remember, I remember everything

A cold shoulder at closing time
You were bеggin' me to stay 'til the sun rose
Strangе words come on out
Of a grown man's mouth when his mind's broke
Pictures and passin' time
You only smile like that when you're drinkin'
I wish I didn't, but I do
Remember every moment on the nights with you

You're drinkin' everything to ease your mind
But when the hell are you gonna ease mine?
You're like concrete feet in the summer heat
It burns like hell when two souls meet
No, you'll never be the man that you always swore
But I'll remember you singin' in that '88 Ford

A cold shoulder at closing time
You were beggin' me to stay 'til the sun rose
Strange words come on out
Of a grown man's mouth when his mind's broke
Pictures and passin' time
You only smile like that when you're drinkin'
I wish I didn't, but I do
Remember every moment on the nights with you
Cold shoulder at closing time
You were beggin' me to stay 'til the sun rose
Strange words come on out
Of a grown man's mouth when his mind's broke
Pictures and passin' time
You only smile like that when you're drinkin'
I wish I didn't, but I do
Remember every moment on the nights with you

Rotgut whiskey's gonna ease my mind
Beach towel rests on the dryin' line
Do I remind you of your daddy in my '88 Ford?

I've been sellin' my soul, workin' all day
Overtime hours for bullshit pay
So I can sit out here and waste my life away
Drag back home and drown my troubles away

It's a damn shame what the world's gotten to
For people like me and people like you
Wish I could just wake up and it not be true
But it is, oh, it is

Livin' in the new world
With an old soul
These rich men north of Richmond
Lord knows they all just wanna have total control
Wanna know what you think, wanna know what you do
And they don't think you know, but I know that you do
'Cause your dollar ain't shit and it's taxed to no end
'Cause of rich men north of Richmond

I wish politicians would look out for miners
And not just minors on an island somewhere
Lord, we got folks in the street, ain't got nothin' to eat
And the obese milkin' welfare
Well, God, if you're five-foot-three and you're three-hundred pounds
Taxes ought not to pay for your bags of Fudge Rounds
Young men are puttin' themselves six feet in the ground
'Cause all this damn country does is keep on kickin' them down

Lord, it's a damn shame what the world's gotten to
For people like me and people like you
Wish I could just wake up and it not be true

I'm rememberin' I promised to forget you now

And my medicine is drownin' your perspective out
So I ain't takin' any fault
Am I honest still? Am I half the man I used to be?
I doubt it, forget about it, whatever
And the dial tone is all I have

I ain't proud of all the punches that I've thrown
In the name of someone I no longer know
For the shame of bein' young, drunk, and alone
Traffic lights and a transmitter radio
I don't like that when they threw me in the car
I gave your name as my emеrgency phone call
Honey, it rang and rang
Evеn the cops thought you were wrong for hangin' up
I dial drunk, I'll die a drunk, I'd die for you

I'll die

Drinks pourin', couldn't stop it
Turn another slow dance into a mosh pit
Tuck my head, then I heard the lock and
Told him that my first car was a Crown Vic
Talkin' 'bout last time I was in the back of a cop car
I fell in love
And my face on the cold window
Try to sober back up and loosen my cuffs
And it's all the same anyway

Mm, I ain't proud of all the punches that I've thrown

I'll change my faith, I'll praise the flag
Let's wait, I swear she'll call me back
""Son, are you a danger to yourself?""
Fuck that, sir, just let me call

Let's wait, I swear she'll call me back
""Son, why do you do this to yourself?""

And I said I ain't proud of all the punches that I've thrown, ah

Travel around the world (Would you cry or would you try to get me?)
Over the phone, droppin' tears (Tell me now, I want you to be clear, yeah)
I get more vulnerable when I do pills (Tell me now, I need you to be clear, yeah)
When you drunk, you tell me exactly how you feel (I won't wait for you, for you)
When I'm loaded, I keep it real (I won't wait for you, I won't wait for you)
Need to tell a real one exactly what it is (I won't wait, won't wait, for you, for you)
Don't say it 'cause you know that's what I wanna hear (I won't wait for you, I won't wait for you)

Yeah, I been trappin' 'round the world
I sit on my balcony and wonder how you feelin'
I got a career that takes my time away from women
I cannot convince you that I love you for a livin' (Won't wait for you, for you)
I be on your line, feeling's flowin' like a river
You be textin' back, you at Kiki on the river (I won't wait for you)
Message say delivered, but I know that you don't get it (I won't wait for you)
Why you introduce us if you knew that you was with him? (I won't wait for you, for you, for you)
Made me shake his hand when y'all been fuckin' for a minute (I won't wait for you, for you)
Walk me off the plank because you know that I'm a swimmer (I won't wait for you)
Supposed to be your dog, but you done put me in a kennel
Girl, put a muzzle on it, all that barkin' over dinner
I was fuckin' with you when you had the tiny Presidential
You got better when you met me and that ain't coincidental
Tried to bring the best out you, guess I'm not that influential
Guess I'm not the one that's meant for you

I can hear your tears when they drop over the phone
Get mad at myself 'cause I can't leave you alone
Gossip in messages, that ain't what we doin', yeah (World was endin')
Trappin' around the world (Would you cry or would you try to get me?)
Over the phone, droppin' tears (Tell me now, I want you to be clear, yeah)

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart

I'll give it to someone special (Special)

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby, do you recognise me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me
""Happy Christmas,"" I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying, ""I love you,"" I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away)

But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears

Oh, oh, baby

A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face-on lover with a fire in his heart
A man undercover, but you tore me apart
Ooh-ooh
Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away)

A man undercover, but you tore him apart
Maybe next year
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special

Special
Someone

I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special
Who give me something in return

Hold my heart and watch it burn
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special
I thought you were here to stay
How could you love me for a day?
I thought you were someone special

I went and bought the biggest bottle they got 'cause you're gone
Drop a needle on a vinyl and cry to an old Haggard song
Sittin' at the table, baby, breakin' the seal
Gonna see how much of this pain I can kill
I went and bought the biggest bottle they got 'cause you're gone

Tennessee and Kentucky
'Cause you ain't here to love me
I drink now that there's nothing to lose
I've been fightin' with your memory
I hate the way it hits me
I wake up every day black and blue
After all this back and forth, a fifth won't do
Yeah, I finally got a handle, finally got a handle on you

I tell myself that I should quit, but I don't listen to drunks
I keep on sippin' 'til ""I miss you"" don't roll off my tongue
Since you poured our love down the sink
I think I'll just stay here and drink
I tell myself that I should quit, but I don't listen to drunks

Tennessee and Kentucky
'Cause you ain't here to love me
I drink now that there's nothing to lose
I've been fightin' with your memory
I hate the way it hits me
I wake up every day black and blue
After all this back and forth, a fifth won't do
Well, I finally got a handle on you

Cuando por las noches recordaba todo
El olor de aquel perfume sobre todo
Las sábanas blancas donde te escondías dentro
Eres intocable como joya de oro
Esas piernas largas comerme yo solo
Y tus ojos grandes, me perdí en un laberinto
Y pensar
Que tú ya no vas a estar
Pasará
Solito me dejará
Intentar
Solo un beso y tú te vas
De mi vida, ah, ah
Como tú no hay nadie más
No hay nadie más
Ah
¿Y qué?
Si te sientes sola no me llames porfa
Me pongo sensible, me imagino tu sombra
Clase Azul es el tequila e interior la ropa

Rico Prat champaña, el polvo es color rosa
Me contactó un ángel, eres tú mi hermosa
La que me alegra los días y sigo tomando
Y pensar
Que tú ya no vas a estar
Pasará
Solito me dejarás
Intentar
Solo un beso y tú te vas
De mi vida, ah, ah
Como tú no hay nadie más

If I could buy a house on Memory Lane
I'd put my money down and I'd sign my name
On that little corner lot where it don't ever rain
And we'd stay good as new like a fresh coat of paint
You'd be mine in the shine of a front porch light
Yeah, I might as well live there, baby
That's where I spend most of my time

Thinkin' 'bout those sunsets that bled into jean jacket nights
Those tangled up mornings lost in paradise
Still drunk on the feeling when I close my eyes
You're pulling me closer, your head on my shoulder
We'd never let go and we'd never be over

If I could buy a house on Memory Lane
I wouldn't have to wonder if you miss me the same
I'd be loving you as usual, telling you you're beautiful
Oh, I'd be happily delusional

Thinkin' 'bout those sunsets that bled into jean jacket nights
Those tangled up mornings lost in paradise
Still drunk on the feeling when I close my eyes
You're pulling me closer, your head on my shoulder
We'd never let go and we'd never be over

Thinkin' 'bout those sunsets that bled into jean jacket nights
Those tangled up mornings lost in paradise
Still drunk on the feeling when I close my eyes
You're pulling me closer, your head on my shoulder
We'd never let go and we'd never be over

If I could buy a house on Memory Lane
I'd put my money down and I'd sign my name
On that little corner lot where it don't ever rain
And baby, me and you, we'd never fade, never fade
We'd never fade

Ten miles out of Chattanooga
South of that state line
There's a no-name road off Highway 2
Just past the welcome sign
It's where I was born, it's where I was raised
Ain't sayin' I'm ready yet
But that's the place I wanna be after my last breath

Bury me in Georgia
Let me rest in peace
Underneath the pines, yeah, yeah, yeah
Where my roots run deep (Where my roots run deep)
Whеn it's my day, put me in that clay
And remembеr what I told you
When I die, bury me in Georgia
Mm-hmm

Yeah, I don't care what color my suit is
Or what shoes y'all put on my feet
I don't care how many show up, yeah
Or who reads my eulogy
Just take me out to that graveyard
Sing a send me home song
Put ""Go Dawgs"" on my headstone (Headstone)
And pile that red dirt on

Bury me in Georgia (Woo)
Let me rest in peace
Underneath the pines, yeah, yeah, yeah
Where my roots run deep (Where my roots run deep)
When it's my day, put me in that clay
And remember what I told you
When I die, bury me in Georgia

Check this out
For my final will and testament
Let this be my last request
Leave it all to my family
You already know what's next
Yeah, bury me in Georgia

Me levanto, un baño y luego me pongo a forjar
Es veneno, da pa'rriba, de muy buena calidad
Los teléfonos no paran nunca de sonar
Si no es alguna plebita, es porque un cliente quiere más

Y bien forrados los paquetes van
No hay pendiente, no puedo fallar
Siempre estoy listo para cruzar
Polvo, ruedas y también cristal
Aquí el papelito viene y va
Las morritas bien locas se van
Disfrutamos, esté bien o mal
De esta vida no me vo'a quejar

¡Eah!
Y bien jalados con la Doble P
Los corridos tumbados
Así nomas, viejo

Fino con las Balenciaga, corridos bien vergas sonaban
Las morritas muy bien bailaban, y yo ando Silver LV
Siento que ando volando ya, carnal
Y aquí nunca nos vamos a quejar
¿Para qué vamos a voltear pa'trás?
No hay pedo, yo le vo'a atorar

Bien forrados los paquetes van
No hay pendiente, no puedo fallar

Y bien forrados los paquetes van
No hay pendiente, no puedo fallar

I love a first cast when the water's glass and the line starts to run
Or that first sip of a cold beer when the working week's done
I love the twilight in the morning 'fore the day wakes up
With the windows down on the first ride in a paid-up truck
And I love a slow down in a beach town with an ocean view
And I love a first fall Saturday trip down to Baton Rouge
And I love a six-string with the stars out and the campfire glow
But girl, that don't even come close

To the way that it feels when you lean in and kiss me
The way that you dance when you get kinda tipsy
I'm wrapped 'round your finger like this ring I'm wearin'
That look in your eye, girl, when you catch me starin'
And I don't even know what it is, but now that I found it
I can't imagine me livin' without this
Back forty view on our piece of ground
Watching you watch the sun going down
That's what my world spins around

Well, I finally get it now, when they say you know, you know
And yeah, girl, you had me from that first hello
And the only thing better is Heaven above
But until I get there, I'll never get enough of

The way that it feels when you lean in and kiss me
The way that you dance when you get kinda tipsy
I'm wrapped 'round your finger like this ring I'm wearin'
That look in your eye, girl, when you catch me starin', and
I don't even know what it is, but now that I found it
I can't imagine me livin' without this
Back forty view on our piece of ground
Watching you watch the sun going down
That's what my world spins around

What my world spins around
Oh, yeah

The way that it feels when you lean in and kiss me
The way that you dance when you get kinda tipsy
And I'm wrapped 'round your finger like this ring I'm wearin'
And that look in your eye, girl, when you catch me starin', and
I don't even know what it is, but now that I found it
I can't imagine me livin' without this
Back forty view on our piece of ground
Watching you watch the sun goin' down

And leave before the mornin' sun

Keep her heart hangin' on 'round every turn
She ain't scared to get tied down, scared to get burned
Just lookin' for somebody as wild as her

Saw that highway unwind in her deep-brown eyes
She saw a long stretch of dirt road dreamin' in mine
She ain't livin' for a diamond ring
Just livin' like the rock 'n' roll song she sings out loud

Backin' down the ramp in my old truck
To find a bunch of logs
To catch a bunch of hogs

If you wanna learn to throw a curve right
To catch a clean up lookin' on a third strike
Talk a little smack while he's walkin' back
Yeah, I wrote the book

But there's one that lays by the lamp on the nightstand
One that says don't cuss and don't fight
Or let the bottle turn you into a different man
But damn if I don't do it every Friday night
Those get you into Heaven letters in red
Ain't gettin' read enough to keep me on a straight line
I'm a Jack of all trades but man I gotta say
That's one book I didn't write

I met a good girl she had her life straight
She said she loved that I was good at everythin'
One day she left me in a cloud of dust
'Cause I never was too good at pickin' up
The one that lays by the lamp on the nightstand
The one that says don't cuss and don't fight
Or let the bottle turn you into a different man
But damn if I don't do it every Friday night
Those get you into Heaven letters in red
Ain't gettin' read enough to keep me on a straight line
I'm a Jack of all trades but man I gotta say
That's one book I didn't write

Yeah, the good Lord knows I need it
I didn't write it but I probably oughta read it

Y cuando te necesitaba diste tu peor versión
Sorry, baby, hace rato
Que yo debí botar ese gato
Una loba como yo no está pa' novato'

Una loba como yo no está pa' tipos como tú, uh-uh-uh-uh

A ti te quedé grande y por eso estás con una igualita que tú, uh-uh-uh-uh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

Esto es pa' que te mortifique', mastique' y trague', trague' y mastique'
Yo contigo ya no regreso, ni que me llores ni me supliquе'
Entendí que no es culpa mía quе te critiquen
Yo solo hago música, perdón que te salpique
Me dejaste de vecina a la suegra
Con la prensa en la puerta y la deuda en Hacienda
Te creíste que me heriste y me volviste más dura
Las mujeres ya no lloran, las mujeres facturan

Tiene nombre de persona buena
Claramente no es como suena
Tiene nombre de persona buena

Es igualita que tú, uh-uh-uh-uh

A ti te quedé grande y por eso estás con una igualita que tú, uh-uh-uh-uh

Del amor al odio hay un paso
Por acá no vuelva', hazme caso
Cero rencor, bebé, yo te deseo que te vaya bien con mi supuesto reemplazo
No sé ni qué es lo que te pasó
'Tás tan raro que ni te distingo
Yo valgo por dos de 22
Cambiaste un Ferrari por un Twingo
Cambiaste un Rolex por un Casio
Vas acelera'o, dale despacio
Ah, mucho gimnasio
Pero trabaja el cerebro un poquito también
Fotos por donde me ven
Aquí me siento un rehén, por mí todo bien
Yo te desocupo mañana y si quieres traértela a ella, que venga también

Threw so many racks, a bitch can't even see the floor
From Atlanta to L.A., the only time I'm back and forth
Cheap niggas make you pick, rich niggas get you both
Gave the Bentley to valet and let that nigga drive the boat
Shh, be quiet (Be quiet), lеt me pop off
Leave thе club sloppy drunk, come home and get my rocks off
Heard ""Bitch from Da Souf,"" he tryna see me knock his socks off
Told them bitches, ""Meet me at the top,"" think they got lost
Tuh, I'm on go like Grizz
She thought I would kiss her ass, she must ain't took her meds, tuh

1199,Watermelon Moonshine,Lainey Wilson,"12 ContributorsWatermelon Moonshine Lyrics
It was right after senior year
Just before the summer disappeared
We went a-ridin' them old farm ruts
Hangin' out on the gate of his truck
We threw a blanket 'neath the sunset
Bein' brave as eighteen gets
We gave each other more than our hearts
With the help of a mason jar

Drinkin' watermelon moonshine
Cut the burn with a little lime
Parkin' back in them kudzu vines
I was his and every bit of that boy was minе
Too young to know what love was
But we werе learnin' on a sweet buzz
There's never nothin' like the first time
And mine's always gonna taste like
Watermelon moonshine

I don't remember where we got it from
I just remember feelin' all grown up
Takin' pulls like it ain't no thing
Never told him it was my first drink
But I told him that he was the one
You're so sure when you're that young
You think you got it all figured out
And now I laugh when I think about

Drinkin' watermelon moonshine
Cut the burn with a little lime
Parkin' back in them kudzu vines
I was his and every bit of that boy was mine
Too young to know what love was
But we were learnin' on a sweet buzz
There's never nothin' like the first time
And mine's always gonna taste like
Watermelon moonshine

I thought that high would last forever
But that ain't what it does
Maybe we were drunk in love
Or maybe we were just

Drinkin' watermelon moonshine
Cut the burn with a little lime
Parkin' back in them kudzu vines
I was his and every bit of that boy was mine
Too young to know what love was
But we were learnin' on a sweet buzz
There's never nothin' like the first time
And mine's always gonna taste like
Watermelon moonshine

Something's got a hold of me lately
No, I don’t know myself anymore
Feels like the walls are all closin' in
And the devil's knockin’ at my door, woah
Out of my mind, how many times did I tell you
I'm no good at bein' alone?
Yeah, it's taken a toll on me, tryin' my best to keep
From tearin' the skin off my bones, don't you know

I lose control
When you're not next to me
I’m fallin’ apart right in front of you, can't you see?
I lose control
When you’re not next to me, mhm
Yeah, you're breakin' my heart, baby
You make a mess of me

Problematic
The problem is I want your body like a fiend, like a bad habit
Bad habits hard to break when I'm with you
Yeah, I know I can do it on my own
But I want that real full-moon black magic and it takes two
Problematic
The problem is when I’m with you I'm an addict
And I need some relief, my skin in your teeth
Can't see the forest through the trees
Got me down on my knees, darlin', please, oh

I lose control
When you're not next to me
I'm fallin' apart right in front of you, can't you see?
I lose control
When you're not next to me (Mm-hmm)
Yeah, you're breakin' my heart, baby
You make a mess of me, yeah

This nine-to-five ain't workin', why the hell do I work so hard?
I can't worry 'bout my problems, I can't take 'em when I'm gone, uh

One, here comes the two to the three to the four
Tell 'em ""Bring another round,"" we need plenty more
Two-steppin' on the table, she don't need a dance floor

I ain't changin' for a check

Woke up drunk at 10 a.m.​
We gon' do this shit again

It's gettin' kind of late, but the ladies want some more
Oh my, good Lord (Tell 'em drinks on me)

Someone pour me up a double shot of whiskey (Double shot of whiskey)
They know me and Jack Daniel's got a history (Way back)
There's a party downtown near 5th Street (Come on)
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy (Woo-ooh)

But lately, I've been doin' better
Than the last four cold Decembers I recall
And I see my family every month
I found a girl my parents love
She'll come and stay the night, and I think I might have it all
And I thank God every day
For the girl He sent my way
But I know the things He gives me, He can take away
And I hold you every night
And that's a feeling I wanna get used to
But there's no man as terrified as the man who stands to lose you

Oh, I hope I don't losе you
Mm, please stay
I want you, I need you, oh God
Don't take
Thеse beautiful things that I've got

Please stay
I want you, I need you, oh God
Don't take
These beautiful things that I've got

Oh, ooh
Please don't take

I found my mind, I'm feelin' sane
It's been a while, but I'm finding my faith
If everything's good and it's great, why do I sit and wait 'til it's gone?
Oh, I'll tell ya, I know I've got enough
I've got peace and I've got love
But I'm up at night thinkin' I just might lose it all

Please stay
I want you, I need you, oh God

To any bitch that talk to him and they in love
Just make sure you hide your lil' sister from him
They tell me Chubbs the only one that get your hand-me-downs
And Party at the party playin' with his nose now

Fucked on Wayne girl while he was in jail, that's connivin'
Then get his face tatted like a bitch apologizin'

Bear with me for a second, let me put y'all on game
The settlers was usin' townfolk to make 'em richer
Fast-forward, 2024, you got the same agenda
You run to Atlanta when you need a check balance
Let me break it down for you, this the real nigga challenge
You called Future when you didn't see the club (Ayy, what?)
Lil Baby helped you get your lingo up (What?)
21 gave you false street cred
Thug made you feel like you a slime in your head (Ayy, what?)
Quavo said you can be from Northside (What?)
2 Chainz say you good, but he lied
You run to Atlanta when you need a few dollars
No, you not a colleague, you a fuckin' colonizer
The family matter and the truth of the matter
It was God's plan to show y'all the liar

Mm

1208,I Remember Everything,Zach Bryan,"35 ContributorsTranslationsDeutschPortuguêsNorsk日本語 (Japanese)EspañolI Remember Everything Lyrics
Rotgut whiskey's gonna ease my mind
Beach towel rests on the dryin' line
Do I remind you of your daddy in his '88 Ford?
Labrador hangin' out the passenger door
The sand from your hair is blowin' in my eyes
Blame it on the beach, grown men don't cry
Do you remember that beat-down basement couch?
I'd sing you my love songs and you'd tell me about
How your mama ran off and pawned her ring
I remember, I remember everything

A cold shoulder at closing time
You were bеggin' me to stay 'til the sun rose
Strangе words come on out
Of a grown man's mouth when his mind's broke
Pictures and passin' time
You only smile like that when you're drinkin'
I wish I didn't, but I do
Remember every moment on the nights with you

You're drinkin' everything to ease your mind
But when the hell are you gonna ease mine?
You're like concrete feet in the summer heat
It burns like hell when two souls meet
No, you'll never be the man that you always swore
But I'll remember you singin' in that '88 Ford

A cold shoulder at closing time
You were beggin' me to stay 'til the sun rose
Strange words come on out
Of a grown man's mouth when his mind's broke
Pictures and passin' time
You only smile like that when you're drinkin'
I wish I didn't, but I do
Remember every moment on the nights with you
Cold shoulder at closing time
You were beggin' me to stay 'til the sun rose
Strange words come on out
Of a grown man's mouth when his mind's broke
Pictures and passin' time
You only smile like that when you're drinkin'
I wish I didn't, but I do
Remember every moment on the nights with you

1209,Too Sweet,Hozier,"It can't be said I'm an early bird
It's 10 o'clock before I say a word
Baby, I can never tell
How do you sleep so well?
You keep tellin' me to live right
To go to bed before the daylight
But then you wake up for the sunrise
You know you don't gotta pretend
Baby, now and then

Don't you just wanna wake up, dark as a lake
Smellin' like a bonfire, lost in a haze?
If you're drunk on life, babe, I think it's great
But while in this world

I think I'll take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at 3
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me
I take my whiskеy neat
My coffee black and my bed at 3
You're too sweet for mе
You're too sweet for me

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

I aim low
I aim true, and the ground's where I go
I work late where I'm free from the phone
And the job gets done
But you worry some, I know
But who wants to live forever, babe?
You treat your mouth as if it's Heaven's gate
The rest of you like you're the TSA
I wish I could go along
Babe, don't get me wrong

You know you're bright as the morning, as soft as the rain
Pretty as a vine, as sweet as a grape
If you can sit in a barrel, maybe I'll wait
Until that day
I'd rather take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at 3
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me
I take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at 3
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me

1210,Stick Season,Noah Kahan,"68 ContributorsTranslationsالعربيةEspañolDeutschFrançaisNorskStick Season Lyrics
As you promised me that I was more than all the miles combined
You must've had yourself a change of heart like halfway through the drive
Because your voice trailed off exactly as you passed my exit sign
Kept on drivin' straight and left our future to the right
Now I am stuck between my anger and the blame that I can't face
And memories are somethin' even smoking weed does not replace
And I am terrified of weather 'cause I see you when it rains
Doc told me to travel, but there's Covid on the planes

And I love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks
And I saw your mom, she forgot that I existed
And it's half my fault, but I just like to play the victim
I'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas
And I'll dream each night of some version of you
That I might not have, but I did not lose
Now you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes
And I'm split in half, but that'll have to do

So I thought that if I piled something good on all my bad
That I could cancel out the darkness I inherited from Dad
No, I am no longer funny 'cause I miss the way you laugh
You once called me ""forever,"" now you still can't call me back

And I love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks
And I saw your mom, she forgot that I existed
And it's half my fault, but I just like to play the victim
I'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas
And I'll dream each night of some version of you
That I might not have, but I did not lose
Now you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes
And I'm split in half, but that'll have to do

Oh, that'll have to do
My other half was you
I hope this pain's just passin' through
But I doubt it

And I love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks
And I saw your mom, she forgot that I existed
And it's half my fault, but I just like to play the victim
I'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas
And I'll dream each night of some version of you
That I might not have, but I did not lose
Now you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes
And I'm split in half, but that'll have to do
Have to do"

Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em

I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)

Зажгу косяк в этой суке
Метро, Метро, Метро, три раза
Йеа

Следуем кодексу, все эти шлюхи созданы для улиц
Засунул ей в нос, теперь её киска потечёт
Ссыкуны стуканули, не увидят света дня
Может, щелчка и не слышно, но слышно, как эти челы вопят
Все мои шлюшки под грибами, бля, все мои шлюшки под коксом
Кольцо двадцать карат, засунул пальцы ей глубоко в рот (А, а, а)
Если карат пропадёт, она удавится (А, а, а)
Я знаю, она сглотнёт, она в этом G.O.A.T. (А, а, а)
Freeband, на хуй, тащи бабки сюда
Мои стрелки в углу, стоят стаей
Она думает, что она экзотическая сучка и поэтому красива
Из-за такого дерьма тебя вынесут на районе, брр
И девиз у нас всё тот же
Шикую, будто выиграл игру за чемпионство
Ты знаешь, как эти шлюхи голодны, они трахнутся за статус
Подтянул её в банду, она трахнулась за цепь
Твоя девка в этой суке, она вертится на члене
У меня сироп в этой суке, тусим в этой суке
Мы принесли Перки в эту суку, наебашимсь в этой суке
Вся эта ювелирка на мне, детка, ну что ж, время поиграть
Зови подружку, сучка, мы трахнем их одновременно
Я на другом уровне, нет, мы не одной породы
Можешь взять ту малую, если её ещё не взял я (Йеа)

Юный дилер, торгуешь дурью, реально ты таков? (Если ты таков)
Выбиваешь двери, вламываешься в двери, реально ты таков? (Йеа)

Эй, так много дурачков с баблом на руках
Ну в смысле, а, надеюсь, что эти сантименты символичны
А, мой темперамент биполярен, я выбираю агрессию
Окей, поехали, пора ему доказать, какой он жёсткий
Чуваки объединяются, но ведут себя неискренне, никакого 40 Water, скажите им
А, йеа, ха, йеа, давай со мной
На хуй скрытые диссы, шутер от первого лица; надеюсь, там есть три переключателя
Я кричу: «На хуй рэп», запишу дисс на Мелли Мэла, если придётся

But they forgot to come and get me
I was a functioning alcoholic
'Til nobody noticed my new aesthetic
All of this to say I hope you're okay
But you're the reason
And no one here's to blame
But what about your quiet treason?

And for a fortnight there, we were forever
Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather
Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors
Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her

All my mornings are Mondays stuck in an endless February
I took the miracle move-on drug, the effects were temporary
And I love you, it's ruining my life
I love you, it's ruining my life
I touched you for only a fortnight
I touched you, but I touched you

And for a fortnight there, we were forever
Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather
Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors
Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her
And for a fortnight there, we were together
Run into you sometimes, comment on my sweater
Now you're at the mailbox, turned into good neighbors
My husband is cheating, I wanna kill him

I love you, it's ruining my life
I love you, it's ruining my life
I touched you for only a fortnight
I touched you, I touched you
I love you, it's ruining my life
I love you, it's ruining my life
I touched you for only a fortnight
I touched you, I touched you

Thought of callin' ya, but you won't pick up
'Nother fortnight lost in America
Move to Florida, buy the car you want
But it won't start up 'til you touch, touch, touch me
Thought of calling ya, but you won't pick up

1222,Fast Car,Luke Combs,"19 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsFast Car Lyrics
You got a fast car
And I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Startin' from zero, got nothin' to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothin' to prove

You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
Been workin' at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just across the bordеr and into the city
And you and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it means to bе livin'

See, my old man's got a problem
He live in the bottle, that's the way it is
He said his body's too old for workin'
His body's too young to look like his
So Mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, ""Somebody's gotta take care of him""
So I quit school and that's what I did

You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
Still gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way

So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
I, I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
We go cruisin', entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
So I work in the market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
And we'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house, live in the suburbs

So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
I, I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinkin' late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me'd find it
I got no plans, I ain't goin' nowhere
Take your fast car and keep on driving

So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
I, I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone


You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
Still gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way"

First thing at dawn, you'd queue the songs and we'd get goin'
But you weren't home, waited on the porch for ya
Sat there alone, all throughout the morn' 'til I
Got a hunch down in my gut and snuck around the back
Empty cans and I'll be damned, your shit was never packed

Did your boots stop workin'? Did your truck break down? (Truck break down)
Did you burn through money? Did your ex find out? (Ex find out)

Was the whiskey flowin'? Were you in a fight? (In a fight)
Did the nerves come get you? What's your alibi? (Alibi)
I made my way back to LA, and that's where you'll be forgotten
In forty years, you'll still be here, drunk washed up in Austin

Hell of a bluff, you had me believin'

So pack the car and dry your eyes
I know they got plenty of young blood left in 'em
And plenty nights under pink skies you taught 'em to enjoy

So clean the house, clear the drawers, mop the floors, stand tall
Like no one's ever been here before or at all
And don't you mention all the inches that are scraped on the doorframe
We all know you tiptoed up to 4'1"" back in '08

If you could see 'em now, you'd be proud
But you'd think they's yuppiеs
Your funeral was beautiful
I bet God hеard you comin'

The kids are in town for a funeral
And the grass all smells the same as the day you broke your arm swingin'
On that kid out on the river
You bailed him out, never said a thing about Jesus or the way he's livin'

If you could see 'em now, you'd be proud
But you'd think they's yuppies
Your funeral was beautiful
I bet God heard you comin'

(Strum it)

If you could see 'em now, you'd be proud
But you'd think they's yuppies
Your funeral was beautiful
I bet God heard you comin'

The kids are in town for a funeral
So pack the car and dry your eyes
I know they got plenty of young blood left in 'em
And plenty nights under pink skies you taught 'em to enjoy"
1230,Thinkin' Bout Me,Morgan Wallen,"13 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolThinkin’ Bout Me Lyrics
Don't know where you at, don't know where you've been
Don't know nothin' 'bout that boy you're into
Don't feel bad for you but I feel bad for him
And all the hell you gon' be puttin' him through
Probably tell him we're a burnt out flame
Probably tell him that I ain't been on your mind
How I ain't nothin' but a long gone thing
You can cuss my name, but baby, don't you lie

When you're tasting what he's drinking, are you thinkin' 'bout me?
When you're ridin' where he's drivin', are you missin' my street?
Every time you close your eyes, tell me, who do you see?
When you're tastin' what he's drinkin', are you thinkin' 'bout me?
Comin' over tonight, wish that truck in your drive was mine
Just like you know it's supposed to be
When you're up in his bed, am I up in your head?
Makin' you crazy, tell me, baby, are you thinkin' 'bout me?
Are you thinkin' 'bout, are you thinkin' 'bout
When you're tastin' what he's drinkin', are you thinkin' 'bout me?

Do you hide your phone? Did you change my name?
When he wants to go to our go-to place
Do you tell him you can't? Then go out of your way
To be somewhere, any damn where I ain't

When you're tastin' what he's drinkin', are you thinkin' 'bout me?
When you're ridin' where he's drivin', are you missin' my street?
Every time you close your eyes, tell me, who do you see?
When you're tastin' what he's drinkin', are you thinkin' 'bout me?
Comin' over tonight, wish that truck in your drive was mine

When you're up in his bed, am I up in your head?
Makin' you crazy, tell me, baby, are you thinkin' 'bout me?
Are you thinkin' 'bout, are you thinkin' 'bout
When you're tastin' what he's drinkin', are you thinkin' 'bout me?

Don't know where you at
But girl, I know where you oughta be

When you're tastin' what he's drinkin', are you thinkin' 'bout me?
When you're ridin' where he's drivin', are you missing my street?
Every time you close your eyes, tell me, who do you see?
When you're tastin' what he's drinkin', are you thinkin' 'bout me?
Comin' over tonight, wish that truck in your drive was mine
Just like you know it's supposed to be

Once the flight had flown (Uh-huh)
With the wilt of the rose (Uh-huh)
I slept all alone (Uh-huh)
You still wouldn't go

Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later
I see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor
You search in every maiden's bed for somethin' greater, baby

Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
""Come here,"" I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passеd out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

(Is it? Is it? Is it?)

Whеn you lost control (Uh-huh)
Red blood, white snow (Uh-huh)
Blue dress on a boat (Uh-huh)
Your new girl is my clone

And did you think I didn't see you?
There were flashin' lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs
And my whispered sighs
Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come runnin'
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

Let's fast forward to three hundred awkward blind dates later (Oh)
If she's got blue eyes, I will surmise that you'll probably date her (Oh, no)
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor (Oh)
You search in every model's bed for somethin' greater, baby

Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
""Come here,"" I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passed out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

1233,Miles on It,Marshmello & Kane Brown,"18 ContributorsMiles On It Lyrics
New truck, big lift
Old roads, we've been
Tearin' up since way back when
But these wheels are innocent
New hitch, new seats, no history
And you just can't fake that
So, let's change that

Girl, let's go put some miles on it
Back of the Chevy with the engine runnin'
Just you and me in a truck bed wide like a California King
We could break it in if you know what I mean
Put some miles on it
Back of the Chevy with the engine runnin'
Just you and me in a truck bed wide like a California King
Wе could break it in if you know what I mean
Put some milеs on it
We could break it in if you know what I mean

All night, no brakes
All tail, no gate
Ain't gotta try too hard
My baby's push to start
All torque, full speed
Off-road, on me
Zero to a hundred fast
My foot ain't touch the gas
I said, ""Hey, baby, slow it down, let's make it last""
You said, ""Where's the fun in that?""

Yeah, let's go, put some miles on it
Back of the Chevy with the engine runnin'
Just you and me in a truck bed wide like a California King
We could break it in if you know what I mean
Put some miles on it
We could break it in if you know what I mean
Put some miles on it
We could break it in if you know what I mean

Mile after mile after mile after mile
Turn up the night like that radio dial
Shoulder to shoulder where nobody knows
Know where we're goin', we ain't goin' home

We're puttin' miles on it
Back of the Chevy with the engine runnin'
Just you and me in a truck bed wide like a California King
We could break it in if you know what I mean
Put some miles on it
Back of the Chevy with the engine runnin'
Just you and me in a truck bed wide like a California King
We could break it in if you know what I mean
Put some miles on it
We could break it in if you know what I mean
Put some miles on it
We could break it in if you know what I mean
Put some miles on it"
1234,I Can Do It with a Broken Heart,Taylor Swift,"I can read your mind
""She's having the time of her life""
There in her glittering prime
The lights refract sequin stars off her silhouette every night
I can show you lies
(One, two, three, four)

'Cause I'm a real tough kid
I can handle my shit
They said, ""Babe, you gotta fake it 'til you make it"" and I did
Lights, camera, bitch, smile
Even when you wanna die
He said he'd love me all his life
But that life was too short
Breaking down, I hit the floor
All the piеces of me shatterеd as the crowd was chanting, ""More""
I was grinnin' like I'm winnin'
I was hittin' my marks
'Cause I can do it with a broken heart
(One, two, three, four)
I'm so depressed, I act like it's my birthday every day
I'm so obsessed with him, but he avoids me like the plague
I cry a lot, but I am so productive, it's an art
You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart

I can hold my breath
I've been doin' it since he left
I keep finding his things in drawers
Crucial evidence I didn't imagine the whole thing
I'm sure I can pass this test
(One, two, three, four)

'Cause I'm a real tough kid
I can handle my shit
They said, ""Babe, you gotta fake it 'til you make it"" and I did
Lights, camera, bitch, smile
In stilettos for miles
He said he'd love me for all time
But that time was quite short
Breaking down, I hit the floor
All the pieces of me shattered as the crowd was chanting, ""More""
I was grinnin' like I'm winnin'
I was hittin' my marks
'Cause I can do it with a broken heart

I'm so depressed, I act like it's my birthday every day
I'm so obsessed with him, but he avoids me (He avoids me), like the plague
I cry a lot, but I am so productive, it's an art
You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart

You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart
You know you're good
And I'm good
'Cause I'm miserable (Haha)
And nobody even knows
Ah, try and come for my job"

Got a .45 on him
And he pushin' 'bout a 102
Always smokin' somethin'
He ain't worried 'bout nothin'
'Cause he ain't got nothing to lose

I got a thing for the hard liquor on ice
Short days and long nights
Marlboros out the window
Middle finger to the sky
Say you wanna get dangerous
Now you're speakin' my language
I forgot what your name is
So, I'ma call you mine (Mine)
I'ma call you mine (Mine)

Got me wide, wide open
Got a .45 on him
And he pushin' 'bout a 102
Always smokin' somethin'
He ain't worried 'bout nothin'
'Cause he ain't got nothing to lose

I got a thing for the wild ones (Wild, wild, wild)
I got a thing for the wild ones, it's like he knew
I got a thing for the wild ones (Wild, wild, wild)
I got a thing for the wild ones, they like me too

(Yeah) I'm attracted to things that are really crazy
Asking me how I've been feelin' lately
Coming for mine, then it's do or die
I won't let it slide, no stealin' bases
No back-and-forth bargainin' (Now)
No bitchin' and arguin'
A whole lotta problems, livin' in Gotham
And Bunnie's my Harley Quinn (My Harley Quinn)
Was raised in the darkness, forgive me, I'm guarded (Guarded)
I have no shame, I'm in love with the heartless
The police will never take us alive
And cowgirls don't cry

Got me wide, wide open
Got a .45 on him
And he pushin' 'bout a 102
Always smokin' somethin'
He ain't worried 'bout nothin'
'Cause he ain't got nothing to lose

I got a thing for the wild ones (Wild, wild, wild)
I got a thing for the wild ones, it's like he knew
I got a thing for the wild ones (Wild, wild, wild)
I got a thing for the wild ones, they like me too

I keep chasing that same old devil
Down the same old dead-end highway
Riding that storm running through my veins
Like a shot down tailspun airplane
Scared of nothing and I'm scared to death
I can't breathe and I catch my breath
But I keep chasing that same old devil
Down the same old dead-end highway

Ain't no love in Oklahoma
Just the whistle of a long black train
You'll know when it's coming for ya
Riding in on the wind and rain

I got saved in the same Red River
The same Red River tryna drown me
It ain't knocking me down, I'm standing my ground
With the whole world falling all around me
I keep running, but I'm standing still
Pray for peace, but I need thе thrill
So I keep chasing that same old devil
Down the samе old dead-end highway

Ain't no love in Oklahoma
Just the whistle of a long black train
You'll know when it's coming for ya
Riding in on the wind and rain

Ain't no love in Oklahoma
Just the whistle of a long black train
You'll know when it's coming for ya
Riding in on the wind and rain
Ain't no love in Oklahoma
Just the whistle of a long black train
You'll know when it's coming for ya
Riding in on the wind and rain"

Well, look what the stork brung
(What?) Little baby devil with the forked tongue
And it's stickin' out, yeah, like a sore thumb
(Bleah) With a forehead that it grew horns from
Still a white jerk
Pullin' up in a Chrysler to the cypher with the vic's, percs and a Bud Light shirt
Lyrical technician, an electrician y'all light work
And I don't gotta play pretend, it's you I make believe
And you know I'm here to stay 'cause me
If I was to ever take a leave, It would be aspirin to break a feve
If I was to ask for Megan Thee Stallion if she would collab with me
Would I really have a shot at a feat? (Ha!)
I don't know, but I'm glad to be back, like

Abra-abracadabra
(And for my last trick) I'm 'bout to reach in my bag, bruh
Abra-abracadabra
(And for my last trick, poof) Just like that and I'm back, bruh

Now back in the days of old me
(When) Right around the time I became a dope fiend
Ate some codeine, as a way of coping taste of opiates, case of O.E
​Turned me into smiley face emoji
My shit may not be age appropri—
Ate but I will hit an eight year old in the face with a participation trophy
'Cause I have zero doubts
That this whole world's 'bout to turn into some girl scouts
That censorship bureau's out
To shut me down so when I started this verse
It did start off light-hearted at first
But it feels like I'm targeted
Mind bogglin' how my profit has skyrocketed, look what I pocketed
Yeah, the shit is just like y'all have been light joggin' and I've been running at full speed
And that's why I'm ahead like my noggin, and I'm the fight y'all get in
When you debate who the best but ops I'm white-chalkin' when
I step up to that mic, cock it then
""Oh my god, it's him... not again!""

Abra-abracadabra
(And for my last trick) I'm 'bout to reach in my bag, bruh
Abra-abracadabra
(And for my last trick, poof) Just like that and I'm back, bruh

Sometimes I wonder what the old me'd say
(If what?) If he could see the way shit is today
(Look at this shit, man) He'd probably say that everything is gay
(Like happy!) What's my name, what's my name?

So, how many little kids still wanna act like me?
I'm a bigger prick than cacti be
And that's why these words sting, just like you were being attacked by bees
In the coupe leaning back my seat
Bumpin' R. Kelly's favorite group, the black guy pee's
In my Air Max 90's
White T's walkin' parental advisory
My transgender cat's Siamese
Identifies as black, but acts Chinese
Like a motherfuckin' hacky sack I treat the whole world, 'cause I got it at my feet
How can I explain to you?
That even myself, I'm a danger too
I hop on tracks like a kangaroo
And say a few things or two to anger you
But fuck that, if I think that shit, I'ma say that shit
Cancel me what? Okay, that's it, go ahead, Paul, quit
Snake-ass prick, you male crossdresser, fake-ass bitch
And I'll probably get shit for that
(Watch) But you can all suck my dick, in fact
Fuck them, fuck Dre, fuck Jimmy, fuck me, fuck you, fuck my own kids they're brats (Fuck 'em)
They can screw-off, them and you all
You too, Paul, got two balls, big as RuPaul's, what you thought you saw ain't what you saw
'Cause you're never gon' see me
Caught sleepin' and see the kidnappin' never did happen
Like Sherri Papini, Harry Houdini, I vanish into the thin air as I'm leaving, like

I'd never met you, but I wanted
To invite you to the party
Then you walked in with those green eyes
Never stolen by nobody
And they flicker to the future
For a moment, I could picture
Then you touch me and I come back
And we're talking on the staircase
'Bout your big dreams on the big screens
Out of Georgia, now you're lonely in this city
Lyin' with me
And you're scared it's movin' quickly
Oh, now you're crying, you're in pieces
'Cause the only love you've ever known is Jesus
I can feel it
Oh, I hate that I'm the reason that you're

In your head right now
While your world is spinning out

So slow it down
Take a moment now
We're too young to drown
Deep in dirty waters
Full of hopeless doubt
Let me pull you out
Let me hold you now
Let me slow it down

Ain't it funny how it changes?
How the future rearranges
I get nervous, oh, I'm anxious
Maybe loving you is dangerous
I could lose you like the others
Only girl that's never left me is my mother
Oh, I love her
And I know you'll probably hate it, but I'm

In my head right now

So slow it down
Take a moment now
We're too young to drown
Deep in dirty waters
Full of hopeless doubt
Let me pull you out
Let me hold you now
Let me (Slow it down)

Slow it down
When you're on the ground
And you're crying
I'm trying (Slow it down)
To slow it down
When you're spinning 'round
In your head

I'll help you slow it down"

Got millions out that rap shit, they hate a bitch, but they stole the flow
Got backend after backend comin', fuck 'em, I stole the show
Don't run up on that bitch, she a headcase, all she do is shoot
I signed my deal up on a PJ and hopped out a parachute
I'm geeked, don't ask me 'bout no more features, I might just stare at you
I'm geeked, don't ask me 'bout no more features, I might embarrass you

Locked in with the gangstas and players, my folks gon' keep it solid
Everything I got on new, it look like I got renovated (Ayy)

Young, wealthy, and ratchet, I'm the hood bitches' motivation (Stamped it)
On top of the world now, they tried to underestimate me (Haha)

Е, е, Плуто

Я не тусуюсь с крысами, это какое-то уникальное дерьмо
Прикончил ниггера так, что это попало в новости, типа того
Пью сироп и Actavis, в стиле Screw
Просто грустная шалава, трахающаяся со всеми пацанами из компании, типа того
У меня дома плохая сука, типа вуду
Уломал Меган Ти Сталлион и ее подруг, типа того

У нее прямо пышные формы, я просто думал, что ты знал, типа того
Я просто потратился, обычно не делаю такую хрень
Карманы набиты, все в синих, типа того
Куча богатых ниггеров, шалавы запутываются, типа того
Ниггер из Атланты, я живу, как Тед Тёрнер, типа того
На камеру, вышибаю челюсти, типа того
Я убрал её, выгнал со студии, типа того
Тихий убийца, я просто остаюсь спокойным с вами, мразями
Надёжный ниггер, который считает деньги, типа того
Катаюсь по городу с твоей подружкой, типа того
Она готова проглотить меня, как суп, типа того
Ты идёшь против пацанов, и ты проиграешь, типа того
Молись Богу, чтобы они вырубили тебя, типа того (Типа того)

Появляюсь, появляюсь, прямо из ниоткуда, типа того
Ввёл Double O в свою жизнь
Серотонин, это крутой тип микса
Оксиконтин, смешаю его с воздушными шариками (Хорошо)
Восточная Атланта чувствуется как зоопарк, такой микс

Мои пацаны давят этого лоха, типа того (Поднимаемся)
Мои пацаны давят этого лоха, типа — (Раскрывай)
Жру все Перки, типа как еду

Исполняю медленный флоу, как в джиу-джитсу (Открывай, складывай)
Красная прядь в моих дредах, я на расслабоне, типа того (Нахуй это, складывай)
Поджариваю ниггера, как еду, типа того (Нахуй это, нахуй это)
Сижу с пацанами, как в «Скуби-Ду», типа того (Нахуй это, ву-у)

Она схватила мои яйца, мне нужно отойти, типа того
Алмазы, они скрывают мои недостатки, я веду себя, как полностью новый, типа того
Сотня патронов в магазине, заставляют его взорваться, звучит, как ядерный взрыв
Все мои джинсы висят, кажется, я слишком тугой, типа того
Привел эту шалаву к банде, теперь она думает, что моя менеджерша, типа того
Малышка думала, что она особенная, но у меня всегда будет сука более значимая
Мне прямо сказали, что всё легко, и я чувствую себя полностью открытым
Восемьдесят одна тысяча на зубы, но я всё ещё не улыбаюсь этой суке
Эта шалава думает, что она лучше меня? Она та самая Инстаграм-модель
Малышка сказала, что я супергерой, так как черт возьми я собираюсь прятаться от этой хуйни?
Эта шалава делает мне минет на заднем сиденье, она типа двигает головой
Все, что я хочу - это жопу и сиськи, у меня нет определенного типа
Попиваю сироп, Плуто, жди
Попиваю сироп, Метро
Сижу прямо здесь с коксом, типа того
Могу поместить алмазы на свои перчатки, воу, как Майкл
Что за херня, вы все обсуждаете тела? Вы просто говорите о бреде (Плуто)

Я не тусуюсь с крысами, это какое-то уникальное дерьмо (Уникальное дерьмо)
Прикончил ниггера так, что это попало в новости, типа того

Молли в моих дредах, а, в стиле Rasta (Раскрывай, раскрывай)
Собираюсь взять шалаву на Теркс, она удивительная (Типа того)

I could be the one, or your new addiction
It's all in my head, but I want non-fiction
I don't want the world, but I'll take this city
Who can blame a girl? Call me hot, not pretty

Baby, do you like this beat?
I made it so you'd dance with me
It's like a hundred ninety-nine degrees
When you're doin' it with me, doin' it with me

Snap and clap and touch your toes
Raise your hands, now body roll
Dance it out, you're hot to go

You can take me hot to go

Well, I woke up alone starin' at my cеilin'
I try not to care, but it hurts my feelings
You don't have to stare, comе here, get with it
No one's touched me there in a damn hot minute

And baby, don't you like this beat?
I made it so you'd sleep with me
It's like a hundred ninety-nine degrees
When you're doin' it with me, doin' it with me

1256,Vampire,Olivia Rodrigo,"Hate to give the satisfaction asking how you're doing now
How's the castle built off people you pretend to care about?
Just what you wanted
Look at you, cool guy, you got it
I see the parties and the diamonds sometimes when I close my eyes
Six months of torture you sold as some forbidden paradise
I loved you truly
You gotta laugh at the stupidity

'Cause I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange
You only come out at night
I used to think I was smart
But you made me look so naive
The way you sold me for parts
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
Bloodsucker, fame fucker
Bleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire
And every girl I ever talked to told me you were bad, bad news
You called them crazy, God, I hate the way I called 'em crazy too
You're so convincing
How do you lie without flinching? (How do you lie? How do you lie? How do you lie?)
Oh, what a mesmerizing, paralyzing, fucked up little thrill
Can't figure out just how you do it and God knows I never will
Went for me and not her
'Cause girls your age know better

I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange
You only come out at night
I used to think I was smart
But you made me look so naive
The way you sold me for parts
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
Bloodsucker, fame fucker
Bleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire
(Ah)
You said it was true love, but wouldn't that be hard?
You can't love anyone 'cause that would mean you had a heart
I tried to help you out, now I know that I can't
'Cause how you think's the kind of thing I'll never understand

I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange
You only come out at night
I used to think I was smart
But you made me look so naive
The way you sold me for parts
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Every couple tries to stop
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later, we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling

You will get a sentimental feeling
When you hear
Voices singing, ""Let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly""

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancin' merrily
In the new old-fashioned way


You will get a sentimental feeling

Every night, 'round about this time
It's like she knows I'm lonely
Rolls up when the wine is gone
Like a record on repeat
Leanin' on old memories
And talkin' 'bout what used to be
She'll probably be the death of me
But damn if it ain't sweet

She's my pretty little poison
My heartache in the night
With a kiss on her lips just like cyanide
Yeah, she came with a warnin'
But I didn't mind
I'll go out on that high every time
She's my pretty little poison
My pretty littlе poison

Shadows dancin' down the hall
Whispers that she wants mе
Try my best not to fall
When she falls into me
We all need some kind of fix
For me, she's the one I'll pick
Nothin' else will do the trick
She's all I need

She's my pretty little poison
My heartache in the night
With a kiss on her lips just like cyanide
Yeah, she came with a warnin'
But I didn't mind
I'll go out on that high every time
She's my pretty little poison
My pretty little poison

For some, I guess it's alcohol
I don't want none at all
I just want you
No, I just want you

My pretty little poison
My heartache in the night
With a kiss on her lips just like cyanide
Yeah, she came with a warnin'
But I didn't mind
I'll go out on that high every time
She's my pretty little poison
My pretty little poison
She's my pretty little poison"

First-person shooter mode, we turnin' your song to a funeral
To them niggas that say they wan' off us, you better be talkin' 'bout workin' in cubicles
Yeah, them boys had it locked, but I knew the code
Lot of niggas debatin' my número
Not the three, not the two, I'm the U-N-O
Yeah
Numero U-N-O
Me and Drizzy, this shit like the Super Bowl
Man, this shit damn near big as the

Big as the what? (Ah)
Big as the what? (Mm)
Big as the what? (Ayy)
Big as the Super Bowl

But the difference is it's just two guys playin' shit that they did in the studio
Niggas usually send they verses back to me and they be terrible, just like a two-year-old
I love a dinner with some fine women when they start debatin' about who the GOAT
I'm like go'n 'head, say it then, who the GOAT?
Who the GOAT? Who the GOAT? Who the GOAT?
Who you bitches really rootin' for?
Like a kid that act bad from January to November, nigga, it's just you and Cole

Big as the what? (Ah)
Big as the what? (Mm)
Big as the what? (Ayy)
Big as the Super Bowl
Niggas so thirsty to put me in beef
Dissectin' my words and start lookin' too deep
I look at the tweets and start suckin' my teeth
I'm lettin' it rock 'cause I love the mystique
I still wanna get me a song with YB
Can't trust everything that you saw on IG
Just know if I diss you, I'd make sure you know that I hit you like I'm on your caller ID
I'm namin' the album The Fall Off, it's pretty ironic 'cause it ain't no fall off for me
Still in this bitch gettin' bigger, they waitin' on the kid to come drop like a father to be
Love when they argue the hardest MC
Is it K-Dot? Is it Aubrey? Or me?
We the big three like we started a league, but right now, I feel like Muhammad Ali
Huh, yeah, yeah, huh-huh, yeah, Muhammad Ali
The one that they call when they shit ain't connectin' no more, feel like I got a job in IT
Rhymin' with me is the biggest mistake
The Spider-Man meme is me lookin' at Drake
It's like we recruited your homies to be demon deacons, we got 'em attending your wake
Hate how the game got away from the bars, man, this shit like a prison escape
Everybody steppers, well, fuck it, then everybody breakfast and I'm 'bout to clear up my plate (Huh, huh, huh)
When I show up, it's motion picture blockbuster
The GOAT with the golden pen, the top toucher
The spot rusher, sprayed his whole shit up, the crop duster
Not Russia, but apply pressure
To your cranium, Cole's automatic when aimin' 'em
With The Boy in the status, a stadium

Ayy, I'm 'bout to, I'm 'bout to
I'm 'bout to, yeah

I'm 'bout to click out on this shit
I'm 'bout to click, woah
I'm 'bout to click out on this shit
I'm 'bout to click, woah
I'm down to click out on you hoes and make a crime scene
I click the trigger on the stick like a high beam
Man, I was Bentley wheel whippin' when I was nineteen
She call my number, leave her hangin', she got dry-cleaned
She got a Android, her messages is lime green
I search one name, and end up seein' twenty tings
Nadine, Christine, Justine, Kathleen, Charlene, Pauline, Claudine
Man, I pack 'em in this phone like some sardines
And they send me naked pictures, it's the small things
You niggas still takin' pictures on a Gulfstream
My youngins richer than you rappers and they all stream
I really hate that you been sellin' them some false dreams
Man, if your pub was up for sale, I buy the whole thing
Will they ever give me flowers? Well, of course not
They don't wanna have that talk, 'cause it's a sore spot
They know The Boy, the one they gotta boycott
I told Jimmy Jam I use a Grammy as a door stop
Girl gave me some head because I need it
And if I fuck with you, then after, I might eat it, what?
Niggas talkin' 'bout when this gon' be repeated
What the fuck, bro? I'm one away from Michael
Nigga, beat it, nigga, beat it, what?

Beat it, what? Beat it, what? Beat it, what? Beat it, what?
Beat it, what? Beat it, what? Beat it, what? Beat it, what?

There were no shootin' stars to use wishin' on you
And all of my sorrows, I'd just wash them down
It's the only peace I've ever found

All of this drinkin' and smokin' is hopeless but feel like it's all that I need
Somethin' inside of me's broken, I hold on to anything that sets me free

I'm a lost cause
Baby, don't waste your time on me
I'm so damaged beyond repair
Life has shattered my hopes and my dreams
I'm a lost cause
Baby, don't waste your time on me
I'm so damaged beyond repair
Life has shattered my hopes and my dreams"

Euphoria

Them super powers gettin' neutralized, I can only watch in silence
The famous actor we once knew is lookin' paranoid and now is spiralin'
You're movin' just like a degenerate, every antic is feelin' distasteful
I calculate you're not as calculated, I can even predict your angle
Fabricatin' stories on the family front 'cause you heard Mr. Morale
A pathetic master manipulator, I can smell the tales on you now
You'rе not a rap artist, you a scam artist with the hopes of being accеpted
Tommy Hilfiger stood out, but FUBU never had been your collection
I make music that electrify 'em, you make music that pacify 'em
I can double down on that line, but spare you this time, that's random acts of kindness
Know you a master manipulator and habitual liar too
But don't tell no lie about me and I won't tell truths 'bout you

Shoo, shoo, shoo
Shoo, shoo, shoo
Bee, bee, bee, bee, bee, bee

Yeah, I'm out the way, yeah, I'm low, okay
Yeah, the island right here's remote, okay
I ain't thinkin' about no reaper, nigga, I'm reapin' what I sow, okay
Got a Benjamin and a Jackson all in my house like I'm Joe, okay
Hellcat, made his homeboys and them type sell they soul, okay
Everybody wanna be demon 'til they get chipped by a throwaway
And I might do a show a day, once a lame, always a lame
Oh, you thought the money, the power or fame would make you go away?
Have you ever played have-you-ever? Okay, nigga, let's play
Have you ever walked your enemy down like with a poker face?
Have you ever paid five hundred thou' like to an open case?
Well, I have, and I failed at both, but I came out straight
I hate when a rapper talk about guns, then somebody die, they turn into nuns
Then hop online like ""Pray for my city,"" he fakin' for likes and digital hugs
His daddy a killer, he wanna be junior, they must've forgot the shit that they done
Dementia must run in his family, but let it get shaky
I'll park his son
The very first time I shot me a Drac', the homie had told me to aim it this way
I didn't point down enough, today, I'll show you I learned from those mistakes
Somebody had told me that you got a ring, on God, I'm ready to double the wage
I'd rather do that than let a Canadian nigga make Pac turn in his grave
Cutthroat business, you got shit twisted
What is it? The braids?
I hurt your feelings? You don't wanna work with me no more? Okay
It's three GOATs left, and I seen two of them kissin' and huggin' on stage
I love 'em to death, and in eight bars, I'll explain that phrase, huh
It's nothin' nobody can tell me, huh
I don't wanna talk on no celly, huh
You know I got language barriers, huh
It's no accent you can sell me, huh
Yeah, Cole and Aubrey know I'm a selfish nigga, the crown is heavy, huh
I pray they my real friends, if not, I'm YNW Melly
I don't like you poppin' shit at Pharrell, for him, I inherit the beef
Yeah, fuck all that pushin' P, let me see you push a T
You better off spinnin' again on him, you think about pushin' me
He's Terrence Thornton, I'm Terence Crawford, yeah, I'm whoopin' feet
We ain't gotta get personal, this a friendly fade, you should keep it that way
I know some shit about niggas that make Gunna Wunna look like a saint
This ain't been about critics, not about gimmicks, not about who the greatest
It's always been about love and hate, now let me say I'm the biggest hater
I hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk, I hate the way that you dress
I hate the way that you sneak diss, if I catch flight, it's gon' be direct
We hate the bitches you fuck 'cause they confuse themself with real women
And notice, I said ""we,"" it's not just me, I'm what the culture feelin'
How many more fairytale stories 'bout your life 'til we had enough?
How many more Black features 'til you finally feel that you're Black enough?
I like Drake with the melodies, I don't like Drake when he act tough
You gon' make a nigga bring back Puff, let me see if Chubbs really crash somethin'
Yeah, my first one like my last one, it's a classic, you don't have one
Let your core audience stomach that, then tell 'em where you get your abs from
V12, it's a fast one, baow-baow-baow, last one
Headshot for the year, you better walk around like Daft Punk


Remember?
Ayy, Top Dawg, who the fuck they think they playin' with?
Extortion my middle name as soon as you jump off of that plane, bitch
I'm allergic to the lame shit, only you like bein' famous
Yachty can't give you no swag neither, I don't give a fuck 'bout who you hang with
I hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk, I hate the way that you dress
Surprised you wanted that feature request, you know that we got some shit to address
I even hate when you say the word ""nigga,"" but that's just me, I guess
Some shit just cringeworthy, it ain't even gotta be deep, I guess
Still love when you see success, everything with me is blessed
Keep makin' me dance, wavin' my hand, and it won't be no threat
I'm knowin' they call you The Boy, but where is a man? 'Cause I ain't seen him yet
Matter fact, I ain't even bleed him yet, can I bleed him? (Bet)
When I see you stand by Sexyy Red, I believe you see two bad bitches
I believe you don't like women, it's real competition, you might pop ass with 'em
Let's speak on percentage, show me your splits, I'll make sure I double back with ya
You were signed to a nigga that's signed to a nigga that said he was signed to that nigga
Try cease and desist on the ""Like That"" record?
Ho, what? You ain't like that record?
""Back To Back,"" I like that record
I'ma get back to that, for the record
Why would I call around tryna get dirt on niggas? Y'all think all my life is rap?
That's ho shit, I got a son to raise, but I can see you don't know nothin' 'bout that
Wakin' him up, know nothin' 'bout that
Then tell him to pray, know nothin' 'bout that
Then givin' him tools to walk through life like day by day, know nothin' 'bout that
Teachin' him morals, integrity, discipline, listen, man, you don't know nothin' 'bout that
Speakin' the truth and consider what God's considerin', you don't know nothin' 'bout that
Ain't twenty-v-one, it's one-v-twenty if I gotta smack niggas that write with you
Yeah, bring 'em out too, I'll clean 'em out too, tell BEAM that he better stay right with you
Am I battlin' ghost or AI?
Nigga feelin' like Joe Hale Osteen
Funny, he was in a film called A.I
And my sixth sense tellin' me to off him
I'ma blick niggas all in they coffin
Yeah, OV-ho niggas is dick riders
Tell 'em run to America to imitate heritage, they can't imitate this violence
What I learned is niggas don't like the West Coast, and I'm fine with it, I'll push the line with it
Pick a nigga off one at a time with it
We can be on a three-hour time difference
Don't speak on the family, crodie
It can get deep in the family, crodie
Talk about me and my family, crodie?
Someone gon' bleed in your family, crodie
I be at New Ho King eatin' fried rice with a dip sauce and a blammy, crodie
Tell me you're cheesin', fam
We can do this right now on the camera, crodie
Ayy, fuck y'all niggas, I don't trust y'all niggas
I wave one finger and thump y'all niggas like mmm
Field goal, punt y'all niggas, they punk y'all niggas, nobody never took my food
Whoever that's fuckin' with him, fuck you niggas, and fuck the industry too
If you take it there, I'm takin' it further
Psst, that's something you don't wanna do

Ooh
We don't wanna hear you say ""nigga"" no more
We don't wanna hear you say ""nigga"" no more
Stop"

I woke up on the wrong side of the truck bed this morning
With a bone-dry bottle of Jack I was pouring
Damn, she got some nerve way she kicked me to the curb
Guess you can say I got what I deserve
'Cause I woke up on the wrong side of the truck bed this morning
(Yeah)

She said, ""Don't come home if you go to the bar""
I said, ""Okay, baby"" then got drunk out in the yard
2 AM I knock knock knocked up on the door
But she never unlock-locked it, guess I don't live there no more

Yeah, she meant business this time
I can't believe my bloodshot eyes

I woke up on the wrong side of the truck bed this morning
With a bone-dry bottle of Jack I was pouring
Damn, she got some nerve way she kicked me to the curb
Guess you can say I got what I deserve
'Cause I woke up on the wrong side of the truck bed this morning
(Yeah)

I used that empty bag of corn to rest my head
A camo jacket for a blanket then passed out like I was dead

Still got one heck of a buzz
If I look a train wreck it's because

I woke up on the wrong side of the truck bed this morning
With a bone-dry bottle of Jack I was pouring
Damn, she got some nerve way she kicked me to the curb
Guess you can say I got what I deserve
'Cause I woke up on the wrong side of the truck bed this morning, yeah
I woke up on the wrong side of the truck bed this morning, yes I did

I can't believe I gotta be at work at nine
That fuckin' bird's about to catch this .45
Oh, I guess if this really is goodbye (Ha)
At least I took my boots off this time, uh

I woke up on the wrong side of the truck bed this morning
With a bone-dry bottle of Jack I was pouring
Damn, she got some nerve way she kicked me to the curb
Guess you can say I got what I deserve
I woke up on the wrong side of the truck bed this morning
With a bone-dry bottle of Jack I was pouring
Damn, she got some nerve way she kicked me to the curb
Guess you can say I got what I deserve"

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowin' and blowin' up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air

What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh

Giddy up, jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jinglin' feet
That's the jingle bell rock

Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square

What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away

To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh

Giddy up, jingle horse, pick up your feet

Say things you don't understand
I can take myself dancing

Match the roses that you left

1269,Where the Wild Things Are,Luke Combs,"14 ContributorsWhere The Wild Things Are Lyrics
My big brother rode an Indian Scout
It was black like his jacket
American Spirit hangin' outta his mouth
Just like our daddy
He kick-started that bike one night and broke mama's heart
He pointed that headlight West, out where the wild things are

He'd call me up every couple of weeks
From South California
Talk about the desert and the Joshua Tree
And his pretty girl stories
And how he bought an Airstream trailer and a J-45 guitar
Said, ""Little brother, you'd love it out here, out where the wild things are""

Oh, oh-oh, it's hearts on fire and crazy dreams
Oh, oh-oh, the nights ignite like gasoline
And light up those streets that never sleep when the sky goes dark
Out where the wild things are

I called my brother from the back of that plane
The second I made it
We started drinkin' on the strip in L.A
And then it got crazy
Ended up at a house in the hills with some Hollywood stars
Kissin' on a blonde in a backyard pool, out where the wild things are
(Oh, yeah)

Couple iron horse rebels
Wild as the devil
I knew I had to move back East
Said goodbye to my brother
At the end of that summer
But I knew he'd never leave

Oh, oh-oh, it's hearts on fire and crazy dreams
Oh, where the nights ignite like gasoline
And oh, oh-oh, them Indian Scouts, man, they're built for speed
And oh, oh-oh, they said he hit that guard rail at half past three
Lit up those streets that never sleep when the sky goes dark
We buried him out in the wind 'neath the West Coast stars
Out where the wild things are

Out where the wild things are"

Just know I learned to hide it well

I almost stayed in bed
Had the devil on my back
And voices in my head

Some days, it all gets worse
Some days, I swear I'm better off
Layin' in that dirt

But God knows, I know

But it's all gonna be alright

Judgin' by the stone-sober state I'm in
Need to crack one wide open

Somebody pour me a drink, somebody bum me a smoke
I'm 'bout to get on a buzz, I'm 'bout to get on a roll
Yeah, I've been breakin' my back just keepin' up with the Joneses
Y'all know what I mean, and y'all know how it goes
When it's up on a Friday and I'm paid, slide one over my way
I can't even think when I can hear one callin' my name (Hey)

Somebody pour me a drink
Pour me a drink

Bourbon-brown eyes tryna get me drunk
Ain't stoppin' 'til the bottle and the job is done
Hey, I think I might've found my future love
Buddy, you should probably buy her one

Somebody pour me a drink, somebody bum me a smoke

This love is getting kinda dangerous
Feels like it's a loaded gun
My mind, it's turning like a cloud of dust
My heart always wants to run

Oh-oh-oh-oh
If you want a cowboy on a white horse
Ridin' off into the sunset
If that's the kinda love you wanna wait for
Hold on tight, girl, I ain't there yet
No, I ain't there yet
No, I ain't there yet

White horse

Someday, maybe you could have your way
Right now's just not the time
Some things a man's just got to do
I wish you could change my mind

Oh-oh-oh-oh
If you want a cowboy on a white horse
Ridin' off into the sunset
If that's the kinda love you wanna wait for
Hold on tight, girl, I ain't there yet
No, I ain't there yеt
No, I ain't there yet

Whitе horse


If you want a cowboy on a white horse
Ridin' off into the sunset
If that's the kinda love you wanna wait for
Hold on tight, girl, I ain't there
If you want a cowboy on a white horse
Ridin' off into the sunset
If that's the kinda love you wanna wait for
Hold on tight, girl, I ain't there yet

But I'm tryna get to know you at least
Don't take my talkin' to you wrong
I can keep it chill like a sauvignon blanc
I'ma keep it real when your man long gone
If you're lookin' for a friend, then you got thе wrong song

Baby girl, what's good, what's with ya?
If you booked tonight, that's fiction

You want mе, go figure

I'ma let you cool down while I walk out
You ain't messing me up like the times before
I don't need a ticket to your shit show
Knock yourself out and hit a new low
Well, I'ma take the high road, take the high road, take the high road

If I catch you with her, you gon' catch me with him

But now I'm broken down

I let you back in and I gave you a second chance
And like a jet plane on a clear blue sky

So this is wherе it ends

Had to bury all your memories
Couldn't see what everybody sees

And time breaks your heart
I wasn't there, but I know
She was your girl
You showed her the world
But fell out of love and you both let go

She was cryin’ on my shoulder
All I could do was hold her
Only made us closer until July
Now, I know that you love me
You don't need to remind me
I should put it all behind me, shouldn't I?

But I see her in the back of my mind all the time
Like a fever, like I’m burning alive, like a sign
Did I cross the line?

Well, good things don't last (Good things don't last)
And life moves so fast (Life moves so fast)

I see her in the back of my mind (Back of my mind) all the time (All the time)
Feels like a fever (Like a fever), like I’m burning alive (Burning alive), like a sign
Did I cross the line?

You say no one knows you so well (Oh)
But every time you touch me, I just wonder how she felt
Valentine's Day, cryin’ in the hotel
I know you didn't mean to hurt me, so I kept it to myself
And I wonder
Do you see her in the back of your mind in my eyes?

You say no one knows you so well
But every time you touch me, I just wonder how she felt

I know you didn’t mean to hurt me, so I kept it to myself"

Girl, when you called it quits
You could have done it right
You coulda left this town out of it
When you said goodbye

You ruined everything I love
Ripped my heart right out my chest
Girl, it's like there ain't nothing left

You set my world on fire
Yeah, it's all long gone
I'm watching flames get higher
And I can't move on
I just gotta let it burn, burn, burn on down
Girl, without you it don't turn, turn, turn around
You set my world on fire
You set my world on fire

Can't hit that corner bar
Can't even ride them roads
Don't know my way around this place
I can't see through the smoke

Piled up every memory
Yeah, you took the good with all the bad
Why'd you have to strike that match

And set my world on fire
Yeah, it's all long gone
I'm watching flames get higher
And I can't move on
I just gotta let it burn, burn, burn on down
Girl, without you it don't turn, turn, turn around
You set my world on fire
You set my world on fire

Ain't nothing left for me
In this old nothing town
Guess all we'll be is ashes on the ground
So, I watch it burn, burn, burn on down
Ain't nothing I can hold on to right now

Hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you (Ahh)

I know I might look like
Another ball cap on a bar stool
Underneath a PBR light
Sayin' everything under the moon
To get you into my arms tonight
You probably heard it all a thousand times
But it ain't what it looks like
Girl, let me tell you what it looks like

You look like waves on a sunset
And you can crash on me all night
You look like wine in a truck bed
A little what I'm doin' for the rest of my life 'cause
You look like I'm done lookin'
But girl the hard truth is
If this night don't turn into two
You look like I'm gonna wind up missin' you

I gotta tell you, baby, I've been
The kind of boy your daddy never wanted
You to go and fall in love with
The kinda boys you're probably done with their dumb shit, yeah
I bet you heard the stories and
Can't say I'm proud of that, but
I've turned the page on the old me
And now I ain't lookin' back 'cause

You look like waves on a sunset
And you can crash on me all night
And you look like wine in a truck bed
A little what I'm doin' for the rest of my life 'cause
You look like I'm done lookin'
But girl the hard truth is
If this night don't turn into two
You look like I'm gonna wind up missin'

Missin' you in the mornin'
Probably for the next few years
When I look back on it
I'll still see you right here

You look like waves on a sunset
And you can crash on me all night
And you look like wine in a truck bed
A little what I'm doin' for the rest of my life 'cause
You look like I'm done lookin'
But girl the hard truth is
If this night don't turn into two
You look like I'm gonna wind up missin' you

Wind up missin' you
Wind up missin' you"

You're still right here, on my mind

Been taking these shots, shots, shots

But the whiskey don't kill likе it's s'posed to do
Baby, your memory must be bulletproof

There ain't no way I'm driving home
I'm three sheets, done tied one on
But this liquor ain't as strong
As your sweet love is

She talks about the future like she's flippin' through a magazine
Finds the beauty in the thrown away and broken things
Gets excited about all my crazy dreams

Got every sunset that she's ever seen memorized
Saves them away for a rainy day or stormy night
The sky is brighter lookin' at it through her eyes

I don't remember
Life before she came into the picture
Brought the beauty I was missin' with her
Showed me colors I ain't ever seen
She took chances
With every wall I built, she saw a canvas
I thank God every day for how He made her
My life was black and white, but she's the painter

She reminds me that it ain't too late to start again
Fine is good, but you need some blue every now and then
How'd I live so long without her reckless touch?

I don't remember
Life before she came into the picture
Brought the beauty I was missin' with her
Showed me colors I ain't ever seen
She took chances
With every wall I built, she saw a canvas
I thank God every day for how He made her
My life was black and white, but she's the painter

I don't remember
Life before she came into the picture
Brought the beauty I was missin' with her
Showed me colors I ain't ever seen
She took chances
With every wall I built, she saw a canvas
I thank God every day for how He made her

Did you really beam me up
In a cloud of sparkling dust
Just to do experiments on?
Tell me I was the chosen one
Showed me that this world is bigger than us
Then sent me back where I came from

For a moment, I knew cosmic love

Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym
Everything comes out teenage petulance
""Fuck it if I can't have him""
""I might just die, it would make no difference""
Down bad, wakin' up in blood
Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up
Fuck it if I can't have us
I might just not get up, I might stay

Down bad
Fuck it if I can't have him
Down bad
Fuck it if I can't have him

Did you take all my old clothes
Just to leave me here, naked and alone
In a field in my same old town
That somehow seems so hollow now?
They'll say I'm nuts if I talk about
The existence of you

For a moment, I was heavenstruck

Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym (Cryin' at the gym)
Everything comes out teenage petulance
""Fuck it if I can't have him"" (Fuck it if I can't have him)
""I might just die, it would make no difference""
Down bad, wakin' up in blood (Wakin' up in blood)
Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up
Fuck it if I can't have us
I might just not get up, I might stay

Down bad (Like I lost my twin)
Fuck it if I can't have him (Down bad)
Down bad (Wavin' at the ship)
Fuck it if I can't have him

I loved your hostile takeovers
Encounters closer and closer
All your indecent exposures
How dare you say that it's—
I'll build you a fort on some planet
Where they can all understand it
How dare you think it's romantic
Leaving me safe and stranded
'Cause fuck it, I was in love
So fuck you if I can't have us
'Cause fuck it, I was in love

Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym (Cryin' at the gym)
Everything comes out teenage petulance
""Fuck it if I can't have him"" (Can't have him)
""I might just die, it would make no difference""
Down bad, wakin' up in blood (Wakin' up in blood)
Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up
Fuck it if I can't have us

My heart could be burnin', but you won't see it on my face
Watch me dance (Dance), dance the night away (Uh-huh)
I'll still keep the party runnin', not one hair out of place

When my heart breaks (They never see it, never see it)
When my world shakes (I feel alive, I feel alive)
I don't play safe, don't you know about me? (Uh-huh)
I could dance, I could dance, I could dance

Dance the night"
