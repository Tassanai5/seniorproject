hows life tell me hows your family
i havent seen them in a while
youve been good busier than ever
we small talk work and the weather
your guard is up and i know why
because the last time you saw me
is still burned in the back of your mind
you gave me roses and i left them there to die
so this is me swallowing my pride
standin in front of you sayin im sorry for that night
and i go back to december all the time
it turns out freedom aint nothing but missin you
wishin id realized what i had when you were mine
i go back to december turn around and make it alright
i go back to december all the time
these days i havent been sleeping
stayin up playing back myself leavin
when your birthday passed and i didnt call
then i think about summer all the beautiful times
i watched you laughing from the passenger side
and realized i loved you in the fall
and then the cold came the dark days
when fear crept into my mind
you gave me all your love and all i gave you was goodbye
so this is me swallowing my pride
standin in front of you sayin im sorry for that night
and i go back to december all the time
it turns out freedom aint nothing but missin you
wishin id realized what i had when you were mine
i go back to december turn around and change my own mind
i go back to december all the time
i miss your tanned skin your sweet smile
so good to me so right
and how you held me in your arms that september night
the first time you ever saw me cry
maybe this is wishful thinkin
probably mindless dreaming
but if we loved again i swear id love you right
id go back in time and change it but i cant
so if the chain is on your door i understand
but this is me swallowing my pride
standin in front of you sayin im sorry for that night

she said dont you worry if i disappear
i told her im not really looking for another mistake
i called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
but then i jumped right in a week later returned
i reckon she was only lookin for a lover to burn
but i gave her my time for two or three nights
then i put it on pause until the moment was right
i went away for months until our paths crossed again
she told me i was never looking for a friend
maybe you could swing by my room around 10
baby bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
well be in between the sheets till the late am
baby if you wanted me then you should have just said shes singin
dont  with my love
that heart is so cold
all over my home
i dont wanna know that babe
dont  with my love
i told her she knows
take aim and reload
i dont wanna know that babe
and for a couple weeks i only wanna see her
we drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
before a text message was the only way to reach her
now shes stayin at my place and loves the way i treat her
singing out aretha all over the track like a feature
and never wants to sleep i guess that i dont want to either
but me and her we make money the same way
four cities two planes the same day
and those shows have never been what its about
but maybe well go together and just figure it out
id rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
but we should get on a plane or well be missin it now
wish id have written it down the way that things played out
when she was kissin him how i was confused about
now she should figure it out while im sat here singing
dont  with my love
that heart is so cold
all over my home
i dont wanna know that babe
dont  with my love
i told her she knows
take aim and reload
i dont wanna know that babe
on my hotel door
i dont even know if she knows what for
she was cryin on my shoulder i already told ya
trust and respect is what we do this for
i never intended to be next get lost
but you didnt need to take him to bed thats all
and i never saw him as a threat get lost
until you disappeared with him to have sex of course
its not like we were both on tour
we were stayin on the same  hotel floor
and i wasnt lookin for a promise or commitment
but it was never just fun and i thought you were different
this is not the way you realised what you wanted
its a bit too much too late if im honest
and all this time god knows im singin
dont  with my love

you said youll love me from the start

可惜誰有沒有愛過 不是一場七情上面的雄辯
匆匆那年 我們一時匆忙撂下 難以承受的諾言
只有等別人兌現
不怪那吻痕 還沒積累成繭
擁抱著冬眠 也沒能羽化再成仙
不怪這一段情 沒空反覆再排練
是歲月寬容 恩賜反悔的時間
如果再見不能紅著眼 是否還能紅著臉
就像那年匆促 刻下永遠一起 那樣美麗的謠言
如果過去還值得眷戀 別太快冰釋前嫌
誰甘心就這樣 彼此無掛也無牽
我們要互相虧欠 要不然憑何懷緬
匆匆那年 我們見過太少世面 只愛看同一張臉
那麼莫名其妙 那麼討人歡喜 鬧起來又太討厭
相愛那年活該匆匆 因為我們不懂 頑固的諾言
只是分手的前言
不怪那天太冷 淚滴水成冰
春風也一樣 沒吹進凝固的照片
不怪每一個人 沒能完整愛一遍
是歲月善意 落下殘缺的懸念

不要緊 山野都有霧燈
頑童亦學乖不敢太勇敢

從何時你也學會不要離群
從何時發覺沒有同伴不行
從何時惋惜蝴蝶困於那桃源
飛多遠有誰會對牠操心
曾迷途才怕追不上滿街趕路人
無人理睬如何求生
頑童大了沒那麼笨
可以聚腳於康莊旅途然後同沐浴溫泉
為何在雨傘外獨行
這麼多好去處 漫遊到獨家村去探誰
既然沿著尋夢之旅出發 就站出點吸引讚許
逛夠幾個睡房到達教堂 仿似一路飛奔七八十歲
既然沿著情路走到這裡 盡量不要後退

還是令大家開心要緊

從何時開始怕遙望星塵
原來神仙魚橫渡大海會斷魂
聽不到世人愛聽的福音
曾迷途才怕追不上滿街趕路人
無人理睬如何求生
頑童大了沒那麼笨
可以聚腳於康莊旅途然後同沐浴溫泉
為何在赤地上獨行

可以任我走怎麼到頭來又隨著大隊走

好幾次把我差點搲傷
我不曾遇過貓這樣
玩了半天一直從後跟上
最終走了睡前回想
才確定那一刻你想我養
但你不會講出所想
令這悲傷一直生長
見我決心走的模樣
便轉身聞路邊花香
你不曾像人類那樣
習慣要解釋自己在網上
講出了 抵消一切哀傷
而我都無法對你講出所想
我是這裡的遊客 家在異鄉
你是唯一的貓 我想過養"

重臨舊情境 我卻哭得出眼淚
時常在聯想 你會溫馨的抱她午睡
然而自己現在沒任何權利 再抱怨一句
我再沒勇氣向你講舊時
沒有勇氣相愛另一次
為你將睡眠忘記 通宵傾談
但已經頓成往事
還是記起無道理的對罵
是年紀小的不智
今天你能忘記
只得我懷念多麼諷刺
輾轉反側將愛活埋 要把你印象減退
重提舊人物 我卻開心得帶恐懼
年月是流水 我也相識一個成長伴侶
殘酷或許是對象面形容貌 也似你少許
我再沒勇氣向你講舊時
沒有勇氣相愛另一次
為你將睡眠忘記 通宵傾談
但已經頓成往事
還是記起無道理的對罵
是年紀小的不智
今天你能忘記
只得我懷念多麼諷刺
如何逃避這戀愛故事
仍然說得多細緻
重覆的震撼 餘震未停止
我再沒勇氣向你講舊時
沒有勇氣相愛另一次
為你將睡眠忘記 通宵傾談
但已經頓成往事
還是記起無道理的對罵
是年紀小的不智
今天再回頭看 這一個男孩子
我怕面對你說到生活時
後悔過往的幼稚爭議
沒你的動人時節 喧嘩歡騰
亦已經並無意義
閒話到此遺憾到此
結論是回憶總要到此
雖則你難忘記
這戀愛遺物終需棄置
再好好過日子"

寒夜跟你到麥記 朱古力當是酒
我若全力追究 你也會來去自由
那種金牛座特性你全沒有
麥記的最後一夜
白燈廣東歌與露宿者
想起廟街某夜 相士說你屬於那些
矛盾波動的千里馬般狂野
就在八月知你住我家附近之後
那夜經過大角咀你細訴小時候
然後我們隔一兩週 便結伴公園夜遊
潛入嶺南之風看不見四周
但是我亦走不進你心裡頭
某夜親吻到似變了男女朋友
但是你從不愛拖手 只是放手進我衣袖
代表只想取暖 是否
麥記的最後一夜
白燈廣東歌與露宿者
這惡俗的不捨 比一起更好過些
才是你遠走的主因 或者

你問是否這樣永遠 不進不退
你說你雙手等我默許
為何我總不讓你伴隨
你說你很想使我 不再獨個流淚
多甜蜜但我不說一句

而你竟微笑說你不怕等下去
而有天我也許終會

幾朵雲在陰天忘了該往哪兒走
思念和寂寞 被吹進了左耳
也許我記不住可是也忘不掉那時候
那種秘密的快樂
聽陰天說什麼 在昏暗中的我
想對著天講 說無論如何
陰天快樂
叫陰天別鬧了
想念你都那麼久那麼久了
我一抬頭 就看見你
那個酒窩
翻山越嶺之後 愛卻神出鬼沒
你像一首唱到沙啞偏愛的情歌
旅途中坐一坐 在鞦韆上的我
原來我忽略的如今想紀念也沒用
那些時光的因果
聽陰天說什麼 在昏暗中的我
想對著天講 說無論如何
陰天快樂
叫陰天別鬧了
想念你都那麼久那麼久了
我一抬頭 就看見你
那個酒窩
過去穿過了現在繞過了未來縫在心海中
帶著你我旅行變成老頭 oh
孤單怕成了習慣所以我淡定走在人海中
偶而想看雲飛卻沒風

記得這一刻 糊塗時

記得當相機 咔嚓時

柔和耀眼全然綻放

雪條棍砌出新美學
走出漆黑角落
看飛鳥也衝開布幕 記得
一身輕巧快樂
背心想要穿得更薄

放狗的途人照舊 牠擒向另一女生膝頭
圍觀到防暴對峙時 也行近看下又走
女生說家有三隻母狗 我說她那味散四周
群眾都起哄話我 還要是你帶頭
著拖鞋紅衫短袖 手執燒賣配清酒
願這街坊裝被捕可免受暴動罪追究
望向星星是哪星球 它突然間飄走
懷疑是航拍後 你竟除下口罩向它揮手
問我想有什麼成就 我本不想活太久
何以這晚之後 我竟想去習武保衛地球
何以見到你後 我竟然會習武鍛鍊身手"

誰 誰最堅強
誰最善良 誰就會更高尚
悲傷最放任面對 沒眼淚放於心裏
浪漫瀟灑拋一句快樂未一定會緊隨
晴天響雷 天空似快要流淚
假使甚麼都不對 假使甚麼都失去
當一轉身晦暗又佔據心底裏 繼續去
失望疲倦害怕 甚麼都擊退
感激著昨日是誰 敢於勇往又是誰
天空若突然沉重得暗影不退 困倦裏
放心去吧 你有我在這裏
找不到自信面對 情緒又蕩來蕩去
但是不甘心歸去 放棄像最易最乾脆
而你堅持 再豁出去
再戴上勇氣的面具
想做的又再告吹 懷疑到自尊粉碎
我最多走到這裏 以後要靠你衝過去
你衝過去 這一次凝住眼淚
今天甚麼都失去 消失漫天烽煙裏
這生命未來其實開創於手裏 繼續去
克服疲倦害怕 一轉身擊退
推翻認知的瑣碎 寫生命新的一句
今天就克服磨練跑往光輝去 進或退
放心去
假使甚麼都不對 假使甚麼都失去
這生命克服磨練打也打不碎 繼續去
失望疲倦害怕 一切都擊退
感激著昨日是誰 敢於勇往又是誰

放心去 開發你新的秩序

其中嘅一份
係幫啲馬迷落注
喺電話投注中心
喺裡面我識唔到朋友
返工食飯 都係一個人
我已經悶到抽筋
但要維生 我諗到一個方法抗衡
開閘前半分鐘
總有好急嘅客人
落注嘅時侯夾雜粗口
聽到我一嚿雲
但佢哋愈係䒐
我就愈係斯文
我話麻煩你重複一次
搞到夠鐘開閘 佢哋就問候我屋企人
佢鬧我正一懵撚
話要叫個經理出嚟問
我都好有禮貌噉回應
先生 麻煩你等等
我既緊張又興奮
同時又扮晒殷勤
喺呢個心情咁複雜嘅搏鬥裡面
我開始搵到工作嘅快感
希臘神話有個故事講述西西弗斯受到諸神嘅懲罰要喺地獄不斷推一塊巨石上山上到山頂塊巨石又會自動碌返落山腳佢每日都要重複呢種徒勞無功嘅工作直到永恆
後人有一個講法話諸神並唔係用推石頭嚟懲罰西西弗斯而係用觀念用我永世都要推石頭實在太慘嘅呢個觀念
西西弗斯知道自己改變唔到命運佢唯一可以做嘅就係繼續推石頭
直到有一日佢發現佢可以蔑視呢個命運甚至用享受呢個過程嚟去否定諸神對佢嘅懲罰於是佢感覺到自己係快樂嘅"

即使我看不透
你並不害怕老去
只害怕剩我一個
你因此默默祈求
我比你先離開
以後的夜裡沒有你牽手
以後的空氣不再一樣
只有我很在意的小事情
沒有了你叫我不要太在意
你曾說
什麼都會有以後
什麼都會很長久
即使我看不透
你並不害怕老去
只害怕剩我一個
你因此默默祈求
我比你先離開
天黑了 我一個人走
分不清是誰先離開了誰
哪裡有你有我
還有以後 和長久
我會說
我們一定有以後
我們一定很長久
即使你看不到
我並不害怕老去
不害怕剩我一個
我也曾默默祈求
你比我先離開
我並不害怕老去
就算只剩我一個
我相信你會一樣
繼續為我閃亮"

來來回回用最快速度在 流浪
無求無尤地往返 淒身漆黑裡跌撞
然而誰在某天於路上 回望
無從忘懷是眼睛閃耀著 如浪
無痕無塵的心臟 掀起這一世嚮往
踏盡長途百次 只想碰面
穿梭於街道上 猶似歷練
妳會否在前與後 差一剎便擦肩
滑道上傾側倒退又轉身
我與妳一刻似是無限近
錯過若於此刻 終於都這樣陌生
月夜下彎身加快又企穩
每晚也不歸家找一個人
徐徐遺忘分針 於抱憾中覓尋
ooh ooh ooh
仍如常滑過冷天踏入 炎夏
糊糊塗塗就快要將舊夢 埋下
迎來奇情遇上她 膽敢展開了對話
同途同行就這麼踩著夢 閒話
説到渴了就對分一支水 喝嗎
迷迷濛濛的笑罵 搞不清這半晚真假
卻已經開花
滑道上傾側倒退又轉身
我與妳一刻似是無限近
碰見就於此刻 始終都這樣陌生
月夜下彎身加快又企穩
這晚我不歸家跟一個人
徐徐遺忘分針 於馬路間共行
但然後妳 卻又轉身
妳要走 沒留下印
說告別於此刻 講喜歡我夠陌生
亮著淚眼吻吻我 妳説再別問
悠悠回眸 我再次揪一揪心
我盼望於新一天 繼續等下文

想分享一句人生嘅金句
就係生得靚仔其實真係冇罪

我係就係唱得有啲聲衰
但係就係勝在唱得有啲 sam hui

我卻怕這個需要 嚇怕精緻的你沉默了
嚇得你不再淺笑 不得了
我哪會不顧一切 膽小成問題太弱了
是妄想太過 到盡處是寂寥
我最愛感覺飄渺 如無從著地又太累了
怕想到這裏哭了 多可笑
凝眸的一息間 不得了
我最怕一再想起 似天空清澈的你
又有哪個可比 悠然自得呼吸吞吐的你
似看破生死 靈魂共振似碰到太驚喜
夏至秋天的距離 月與倒影的距離
猶如站在 遠方的你
愛意似心裏鬱結 然而重遊舊地又怕遇見
是你嗎 細碎故事再想一遍
怕我太興奮不已 說抱歉講幾次太在意
說穿了這個鬱結 可不可以
我最怕一再想起 似天空清澈的你
又有哪個可比 悠然自得呼吸吞吐的你
似看破生死 靈魂共振似碰到太驚喜
若你依稀一皺眉
我在半空 降落何地
我最愛一再想起 細聲稱呼我的你
放肆跟我一起 連沉默光陰都可以很美
未當我知己 情願別心急這刻揭穿你
用最安好的距離 未會牽手的距離
凝視近在 前方的你"

生死間千迴陌路
重逢那一個擁抱
可有 或無
浮華裡歡笑苦惱
電光閃爍 荒草掛露
便停步 忘掉明哲靜禱
悲憫中鼓舞 困惑中迷路
才驟覺 樂與苦原自創造
繁星怎麼要發光 直到天曉
真空幻化光線 隨處閃耀
陪同在黑夜 路人杳
儲起的 微笑
留待燦爛晨曦 才用掉
繁星怎麼要發光 自有分曉
青空萬里俯瞰 全世界對焦
困囿時分秒 看人類多麼渺小
沉迷在見識 破醒不了
重投冥海那冰凍
漆黑跟光明互動
彌留暖風裡憶記
清澈 朦朧
狂和妄堆砌傷痛
往砂堡送 多少破洞
被愚弄 迎來明鏡望通
虛構中的 我
戲劇裡有多勇
謝謝 你 陪著破夢
繁星怎麼要發光 自有分曉
青空萬里俯瞰 全世界對焦
困囿時分秒 看人類多麼渺小
沉淪在昨晚與他朝
原為了因還未了
勇闖今生缺口 他生再走 woo
哪須千生借口 在這一刻放手
誰在對視無聲
子虛 和烏有
重生的心跳
群星一起再發光 破開天曉
虛空幻變的愛 完美閃耀
陪同在黑夜 路人杳
儲起的微笑
留待宇宙臨終 無預兆
群星一起 叫蒼穹融掉
盤旋萬里青空上 俯瞰逐吋對焦
殞滅時分秒 看人類即使渺小
誰在說我愛你那刻
情存萬有 才是美妙
照耀 恨不了
再恨 仍照耀"

你話你未見過海
你問香港係唔係好繁榮
你問香港嘅海係點
你話上年返鄉下種田之後覺得
人應該留喺城市
我話 香港有啲年青人開始學種田
你話香港咁繁榮
點會有人去種田
努力又是什麼
如果目標已經出錯
這裡有沒有人清楚
越努力越錯得多
人生是什麼
我今晚不知道喎
這裡有沒有人可
將一切告訴我"

死得 鹹魚無能翻身
揭開你的腦袋
全都裝些豬糞
啞忍 祈求能平息這紛爭
無人前來關心
這開掛的半生
已丟失體溫
朝早九點經已開始瞓身
怎麼的發奮都仿似招不了魂
用自尊換取的安穩薪金
一點都不開心 畜生不配有對等
出生必須按守規則跟方針
升職加薪不看優質作品
真的很不甘心 真的很不甘心
再不想掏空這血身
沒有高等的偉大理想
沒有刻苦的既定印象
沒按你的方向 太不識相
從小只得到幾巴掌
懶理周遭的怪異眼光
唾棄的聲音繼續碰撞
僅僅不會死也不發慌
不需爭與搶餓了就賺夠繼續於家裡躺
打工先靠譜 買樓好過租
結婚多美好 人應該多生點小寶寶
每聽到就會暴躁 白眼已反到後腦
有錢有車有樓我生堆給你好不好
戰後的爺爺嬤嬤有錢也不敢花
年少氣盛的平成娃娃種一生只有瓜
太懶惰腐敗風氣被敗壞
一堆不長進的小孩
寧願被社會責怪
也不背一生負債
得到幾多先夠安享半生
輾轉的一生終需要安土入墳
慾望低也可簡單的開心
恭喜不開香檳 啤酒都夠有快感
不需彰顯身份高等奢侈品
只想安躺家裡撫摸軟枕
即使很不甘心 即使很不甘心
也必須找方法偷生
沒有高等的偉大理想
沒有刻苦的既定印象
沒按你的方向 太不識相
從小只得到幾巴掌
懶理周遭的怪異眼光
唾棄的聲音繼續碰撞
僅僅不會死也不發慌
不需爭與搶餓了就賺夠繼續於家裡躺
設法地上游想竄改權力戰鬥
多麼想拯救但無奈仍在蟻丘
不肯改寫擠壓血符咒
只可睜開雙眼看著人口
繼續下流 繼續下流
直到沒以後
哪怕給標籤懶惰廢青
也要守好心那份潔凈
沒按你的綱領 太不尊敬
辭請這種啞口吞聲
下半生只想半夢半醒
過每一天都有悟有命
不打擾你的富足美景
請你都不要干涉這種低慾望社會烏蠅"

仍能安躺 哪管水花四濺
讓我
水作棺殮 化身甜點
能化做養份也應該 無須要為此感概
沉沒在大海怎配有權被愛
命運若一早記載緣份不再
擁有沒有 不必追究
回報是見著那些笑口
鯨落入大海只有冷仍綻放
寂靜在暗淵漸降
海魚即管吃喝
遺愛後葬於海溝這軀殻
天際展翅飛如何想像
海裡撥鰭泳難同順暢
儘管相似 為何總是未見一飛上天
就算
翻背幾次 也都如此
鯨拍翼卻沒到天空 餘生也往深海送
沉沒在大海怎配有權被愛
命運若一早記載緣份不再
擁有沒有 不必追究
回報是見著那些笑口
鯨落入大海只有冷仍綻放
寂靜在暗淵漸降
海魚即管吃喝
遺愛後葬於海溝這軀殻
魂魄附泡沫上水面 乘蒸氣盡化煙
掉落在深海也有其用處
別剩自尊心暗裡無奈打轉
不怕受挫 專心給予
如掛念你便勇敢的說
落下淚捨身替你成大志
若是為你我可以
自願犧牲走進歷史
閉目 沉下去"

而漩渦之中 得你醉
曾願望共你可

看懂 枯山水

成婚了 再飛去

為何還尋 風呂
你跳出深淵 再折返深淵
不 要面對
由它破碎 自毀哪有程序
內疚的深淵 竟是庭園
山長水遠
直線跟曲線 似靜態
卻有些死結 正在解

我再沒勇氣向你講舊時 沒有勇氣相愛另一次
為你將睡眠忘記 通宵傾談 但已經頓成往事
還是記起 無道理的對罵是年紀小的不智
今天你能忘記 只得我懷念 多麼諷刺
輾轉反側將愛活埋 要把你印象減退
重提舊人物 我卻開心得帶恐懼
年月是流水 我也相識一個成長伴侶

我再沒勇氣向你講舊時 沒有勇氣相愛另一次
為你將睡眠忘記 通宵傾談 但已經頓成往事
還是記起 無道理的對罵是年紀小的不智
今天你回頭看 這一個男孩子
我怕面對你說到生活時 後悔過往的幼稚爭議
沒你的動人時節 喧譁歡騰 亦已經並無意義

定格在最滿足 的表情
誰要用嘆息 沾污尾聲

以我沾濕的眼睛 對美好光景致敬
曾跟你蓋起過天國 半世幸福寄託
就算被清拆難重獲 還能悼念亦快樂
携手看晚燈那感覺 教以後都振作
就算是一個人淪落
往事發亮 潤澤了乾涸

對象是誰 可這樣快樂
同搭過尾班車 追盛世
到站二人 又如何切割

all i did was lay in bed and cry
but after one month i started to move on
and after two i felt alright
then three months in you were off my mind
and month four and five i was living my life
i was better and didnt have to try
not to think of you until you reached out and said
remember that night
we went for a drive 230 in the morning
i kissed you it was pouring
we held each other tight
before the night was over
you looked over your shoulder
oh i was doing fine
you said remember that night remember that night

the day after you had reached out
i was broken for the second time around
i prayed on the third day that i would be okay
that id forget you were ever mine

to get better and never have to try

it amazes me you move on so easily
from someone that you once called home
i wish you had enough discipline for the both of us
just because i dont know how to turn off the way i feel
i know you always fell out love so damn easily but honestly
i dont think you ever had something real
until you met me
drinks in new york city
ooh you looked so pretty
think i fell in love before i even knew your birthday
kissed you on our first date
somehow i knew someday
this would hurt cause i could never let you go
oh ill spend my whole life
missing a part of me part of me
oh ill spend my whole life
hoping your heart is free heart is free
ive been trying not to think of this as something tragic
cause our two paths might cross again
crazier things have happened
and i realize lightning strikes just once not twice
and shooting stars are burning rocks
so i spend weeks inside drowning in these dreams of mine

this would hurt cause i could never let you go
do you not dream of me
cause i have visions in my sleep
i cant ever find my peace now
do you wake up alone
and feel an aching in your bones
or are you happy without me now
the first time that you told me
you thought that you loved me
that bar in the city
i thought you were drunk
but i knew deep down that you meant it
wish that i had said it
i was scared to let it happen
but it happened and now i cannot forget it

wise little smile that spoke so safely
he booked a oneway ticket
out west thats where they make it
six kids stuck in a bedsit
to sunswept poolside riches
he met a girl who wore versace
pink feather coats and jumbo jewelry
gonna be a hoop phenomenon
hes gonna be hakeem olajuwon
hes got a gold camaro
he said over the payphone
i try to keep my cool but
my life turns in slow motion

i wish you could see the wicked truth
caught up in a rush its killin you
screamin at the sun you blow into
curled up in a grip when we were us
fingers in a fist like you might run
i settle for a ghost i never knew
super paradise i held on to
but i settle for a ghost
where i was from in nola
no one left to be a rock and roll star
hed stay and treat his lady
give everything to his new baby
i miss him dont you blame me
that boy went stone cold crazy
caught up in camera lust
hes chasin that pappy pipe dream
ooh ooh
i know you dont but i
i know you dont but i still try
my thunder shook him down
my thunder came and shook him down
that girl is gone but i
that girl is gone but i still try

they make technology high quality complex physiological
experiments and sacrilege in the name of public good
they taught me everything just like a daddy should
and you were beautiful and vulnerable and power and success
god damn i fell for you your flamethrowers your tunnels and your tech
i studied code because i wanted to do something great like you
and the real tragеdy is half of it was true
but weve been fuckin mеan were elitist were as flawed as any church
and this fauxrad west coast dogma has a higher fuckin net worth
i bit the apple cause i trusted you it tastes like thomas malthus
your proposal is immodest and insane
and i hope someday selmers rides her fuckin train
i loved you i loved you i loved you its true
i wanted to be you and do what you do
i lived here i loved here i thought it was true
i feel so stupid and so used
i feel so used
i was your baby your firstborn the hot girl in your compsci class
and i was darwins prep school dream bred born and raised to kick your ass
i fell for circuit boards rocket ships pictures of the stars
if you could only be what you pretend you are
when i said take me to the moon i never meant take me alone
i thought if mankind toured the sky it meant that all of us could go
but i dont want to see the stars if theyre just one more piece of land
for us to colonize for us to turn to sand
cause were so fuckin mean were so elitist were as fucked as any church
and this bullshit west coast dogma has a higher fuckin net worth
i bit the apple cause i loved you and why would you lie
and then i realized youre just as naïve as i am
oh youre so traumatized it makes me want to cry
you dumb bitch
i loved you i loved you i loved you its true
i wanted to be you and do what you do
i lived here i loved here i bought it its true
im so embarrassed i feel abused
well i dont want to eat the rich id have to eat my heroes first
and my tuitions paid by blood i might deserve your fate or worse
but i dont need your god damn money i dont need jack shit from you
so when i speak you bet your life my words are true
let me level with you man as someone guilty of the game
i took the help i took the cash i wouldve taken your last name
so if any girl on earth should get to make a call about this
it should be me and as i see it youre a dick
so fuck your tunnels fuck your cars fuck your rockets fuck your cars again
you promised youd be tesla but youre just another edison
cause tesla broke a patent all you ever broke were hearts
i cant believe you tore humanity apart
with the very same machines that could have been our brand new start
and the worst part is
i loved you i loved you i loved you its true
and sometimes i feel like i still fuckin do
i lived here i loved here i bought it its true
im so embarrassed i feel abused

with candy canes and silver lanes aglow

on your own front door
a pair of hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots
is the wish of barney and ben
dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
is the hope of janice and jen
and mom and dad can hardly wait for school to start again
its beginning to look a lot like christmas
everywhere you go
theres a tree in the grand hotel one in the park as well
its the sturdy kind that doesnt mind the snow
its beginning to look a lot like christmas
soon the bells will start
and the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
right within your heart

荒れ狂う季節の中を二人は一人きり さらり
明け行く夕日の中を今夜も昼下がり さらり
どれほど朽ち果てようと最後にゃ笑いたい
何のために戦おうとも動機は愛がいい
aah
新しい日々は探さずとも常に ここに ここに
色々見てきたけれどこの瞳は永遠に きらり
あれほど生きてきたけど全ては夢みたい
あれもこれも 魅力的でも私は君がいい

全てがきらり
無くしてしまったものを振り返って ほろり
時には途方に暮れてただ風に吹かれて ゆらり
息せき切ってきたの
行き先は決めたの
迷わずに行きたいけど保証はしないよ
何か分かったようで 何も分かってなくて
だけどそれが分かって本当に良かった
新しい日々は探さずとも常に ここに
常にここに ここに
色々見てきたけれどこの瞳は永遠に きらり
永遠に きらり
生きてきたけど全ては夢みたい
あれもこれも魅力的でも私は君がいい

quiero decir el mundo está en negatividad pero todos saben a quien me dirijo
ah
estamos a punto de alimentar a estos jóvenes al metaverso
mientras tanto estoy aquí solo tratando de escribir un verso
porque he terminado de ser extra con los extrovertidos
mi discografia solía preguntarse cómo se supone que debo estar al lado de vert
probablemente nunca pensaron que haría que estas piernas funcionaran
trabajo duro pero la mierda dura no necesita trabajo extra
por eso aparezco en sudadera y lo dejo ardiendo
el mundo es mío solo digo al diablo déjalo girar
la chica es mía solo digo al diablo ten un turno
los goats me llaman a un lado como podemos tener una palabra
podría haberme enfrentado pero hice esta mierda como lo preferí preferí
mmm sé que debería ser humilde pero es algo que no he aprendido
más pronto tengo que hacer que estos malos hábitos se quemen
muy pronto vamos a venir y obtener la mierda que ganamos
no eres un fan ahora pero recuerdo cuando solías ser un fan
supongo que cuando todo el mundo te ama la gente solo tiene una forma de sobresalir
todo ese tiempo en la cocina finalmente salió bien
puse un poco de sabor en una olla y saqué el soso
sé que a mi abuelo le daría un infarto si sacara cien mil dólares
así que no voy a sacar cien mil dólares
soy el hiphop lo entiendes completamente
es totalmente automático con los atascos y no se atascan
en los espectáculos estoy a punto de empezar a repartir programas
porque ustedes necesitan seguir el programa
soy un maldito hombre adulto llámame papá
vete a la mierda y toma tu teléfono hombre
todos conocen a jack pero no conocen a jack hombre
solo saben que tengo ritmos las putas y los espectáculos repletos
no hay demasiados inconvenientes cuando juegas con los profesionales
excepto por cómo tu vida queda expuesta pero hago ese sacrificio por la vida que elegí
sé que en toronto se ablandaron por la rosa pero la escuela está cerrada en kentucky así que me gustaba cuando nevaba
los niños llevan palillos no para el arroz en el bol
todos los consejeros escolares saben cómo es su vida en casa
frío como los minnesota vikings en casa
antes de conocer a drizzy sabía que él y yo nos llevaríamos bien
pero es muy difícil contar chistes cuando realmente quieres un consejo
me refiero a cómo es tocar oro cada vez que tocas un micrófono tocando alturas nadie lo toca en la vida
maldita sea joven soltero qué es una esposa
una vez en la vida hasta que diga que lo quiero dos veces
el único en su clase sé que tu todo es uno de los míos
buscando carteles con mi cara ellos saben por quién soy buscado
si
si
corazones fríos y pisos con calefacción sin la orientación de los padres solo veo el divorcio
sesiones de terapia estoy en la sala de espera leyendo forbes
en problemas de abandono por los que me están tratando
cuánta agua puedo meter debajo del puente antes de que se desborde
mi hijo tiene que aprender que el perdón es un camino solitario
las casas están en su rueda como unas casas rodantes
a los negros les encanta probar y probarnos como si supieran en qué estamos
chubb tiene la portada de la revista como rolling stone
porque ya sabemos cómo se loquean tiran piedras
cada vez que te haces más grande hay dolores de crecimiento
tengo suficiente fuerza para hacer que la ciudad comience a lanzar sus juegos
estoy aquí haciendo una burla
tengo a mi agente de bienes raíces aquí jugando monopoly
cómo puedo dirigirme a usted si no tiene una propiedad
solo te afinan cuando no te mueves correctamente
destinado a la victoria pero no me sacas un premio
estoy destinado a la cima pero no puedes sacarme de quicio
75 por la ronda canarios y brillan
hombre estos negros lanzan basura tiran basura
estoy entregando en exceso al punto es menospreciarlo
quiero decir el trastorno de estrés postraumático se está desencadenando la ganancia es repugnante
las piedras brillan vienen del norte
pero me puse caliente como la mierda así que no tengo escalofríos sí
que suerte la gente que no me jode
se están conectando con personas que no me joden para joderme
esta mierda se está poniendo fea
y cada situación es transaccional
y todo lo que dicen es irracional
y todas las formas en que se mueven son promocionales
todos actúan irremplazablemente es como si no fueran desechables
mis impulsos de venganza son incontrolables
aunque sé que nos estamos haciendo mayores sí
pero tengo que recuperar a un negro por eso
no es negociable ni siquiera es discutible
me estoy volviendo muy rico mi música ni siquiera es identificable
tiro hacia adelante es un inflable
nene de azul en clase g me siento como un niño otra vez
rezar por mi ruina no te hace religioso hombre
todo lo que escucho es hablar de enchufes provenientes de intermediarios
todo lo que escucho son cuentos chinos de hombres pequeños
cuando digo perra rara vez me refiero a mujeres
la mayoría de las perras que conozco son negras ni siquiera son mujeres
sé que suena como si estuviera siendo gracioso ni siquiera estoy bromeando
los mismos que dicen que hacen funcionar el juego cuando ni siquiera están en él
para ser honesto todas las situaciones financieras son mi mayor motivación
y cómo debe tomar esa declaración se basa en lo que está haciendo
carros y cadenas como una dominatriz wap pssh
si te veo te escupo en la cara hatu
daytonas con las caras verdes
carreras de derby de kentucky mi presencia en el lugar es tan abrasiva
boxeó en los churchill downs eso es motivación sí
y mi chica dijo sabes que ese chico de jack está yendo a lugares
lo sé
sí"

항상 나답게 처음의 나에게 부끄럽지 않게

젖은 날엔 함께 늘

하루만 내게 시간이 있다면
달콤한 니 향기에 취해서 곤히 난 잠들고파
빡빡한 스케줄 사이에 기회가 있다면
따스하고 깊은 눈 안에 몸 담그고파
i like that 너의 그 길고 긴생머리
올려 묶을 때의 아찔한 목선과 흘러내린 잔머리
서로 같이 어딜 가든 내 핸드백은 니 허리
yo ma honey
볼 때마다 숨이 막혀 명동 거리처럼
우리의 bgm은 숨소리
내 이름을 불러줄 때의 니 목소리에
잠겨서 난 수영하고파 너를 좀 더 알고파
너란 미지의 숲을 깊이 모험하는 탐험가
너란 존재가 예술이니까
이렇게 매일 난 밤새도록 상상을 해
어차피 내게는 무의미한 꿈이니까

그럴 수 있다면 얼마나 좋을까
아무데나 가서 밥 먹고 영화
한 편만 볼 수만 있다면
나란 애 정말 뭔 짓이라도 할 텐데 girl
im sorry 내 머리가 넘 이성적인가 봐
그래도 언젠가 보면 웃어줘
조금은 아니 어쩌면 많이 날 원망하겠지
알아 내 꿈 때문에 널 더 바라보지 못해서
그럼 내게 하루만 줘 꿈 속이라도 하루만
현실을 핑계 대며 삼켜야 했던 그 수많은 말
중에서 딱 한 마디만 제대로 할 수 있게
그래 나팔꽃이 필 때 만나 헤어지자 꽃이 질 때
쉽게 잊혀질 거라 생각 안 했지만
너에게 난 그랬음 좋겟다면 이기적일까
널 위해서라며 아직 난 거짓말하고 있어
넌 내 한가운데 서 있어
하루만 너와 내가 함께할 수 있다면
하루만 너와 내가 손잡을 수 있다면
하루만 너와 내가 함께할 수 있다면
하루만 하루만
너와 내가 하고 있다면 lets go time
24 hours 너와 단둘이
있다면 아침부터 입맞춤해
삐질 수 없는 브런치도 한 입 해
손잡고 너와 햇빛에 몸 담그네
안 끝내 아름다운 밤중에
너에게 고백해 조명은 달로 해
이 수많은 일들이 내게 말을 해
단 하루만 있으면 가능해
하루만 너와 내가 함께할 수 있다면
하루만 너와 내가 손잡을 수 있다면
하루만 너와 내가 함께할 수 있다면

그때 왜 그랬는지 왜 날 내쫓았는지
어떤 이름도 없이 여전히 널 맴도네
작별이 무색해 그 변함없는 색채
나에겐 이름이 없구나
나도 너의 별이었는데
넌 빛이라서 좋겠다
난 그런 널 받을 뿐인데
무너진 왕성에
남은 명이 뭔 의미가 있어
죽을 때까지 받겠지
니 무더운 시선
아직 난 널 돌고 변한 건 없지만
사랑에 이름이 없다면
모든 게 변한 거야
넌 정말로 eris를 찾아낸 걸까
말해 내가 저 달보다 못한 게 뭐야
us는 u의 복수형일 뿐
어쩌면 거기 처음부터 난 없었던 거야
언젠가 너도 이 말을 이해하겠지

노랜 멈췄어 노랜 멎었어

넌 날 지웠어 넌 날 잊었어
어제와는 그리 다를 건 없네 ay
똑같은 일상 속에 딱 너만 없네 ay
분명 어제까지는 함께였는데 ay
무서울 정도로 똑같은 하루 속엔 딱 너만 없네
솔직히 말해 니가 없던 일년쯤
덤덤했지 흔히 말하는 미련도
없던 지난 날 이젠 깜빡
니 향기 따윈 기억도 안나 잠깐
근데 어디선가 맡아봤던 향순데 ay
기억이 어렴풋이 피어날 즘에 ay
저기 저기 고개를 돌려보니
환하게 웃으며 다가오는 니 옆엔 그
안녕 안녕
어떻게 지내 나는 뭐 잘 지내
왠지 터질듯한 내 심장과는 달리
이 순간 온도는 영하 248
난 맴돌고만 있어
난 널 놓쳤어 난 널 잃었어
난 헛돌고만 있어
넌 날 지웠어 넌 날 잊었어
한때는 태양의 세계에 속했던
노랜 멈췄어 노랜 멎었어
별의 심장엔 텁텁한 안개층뿐
넌 날 지웠어 넌 날 잊었어
난 맴돌고만 있어
안개 너머의 여전히 미소 띤 널 지켜보지
의미도 너도 다 없는 불규칙 내 궤도의 현실
난 헛돌고만 있어
너에겐 기억하기 힘든 숫자와 어둠의 pluto
그래도 계속 난 너의 주위를 맴돌겠지 damn
난 맴돌고만 있어
난 널 놓쳤어 난 널 잃었어
난 헛돌고만 있어
넌 날 지웠어 넌 날 잊었어

이게 내가 바랬던 연애 꿈
파란만장 러브 스토리 다 어디 갔나
드라마에 나온 주인공들 다 저리가라
너 때문에 수 백번 쥐어 잡는 머리카락
너 담담 그저 당당 날차 빵빵
뭐니 뭐니 난 네게 뭐니
너보다 니 친구에게 전해 드는 소식
원해 원해 uh 너를 원해
너란 여자 사기꾼 내 맘을 흔든 범인
불이 붙기 전부터 내 맘 다 쓰고
일방적인 구애들 해 봤자 헛수고
너에게 난 그저 연인이 아닌 우정이
편했을지도 몰라 im a love loser

주변을 압도하는 분위기에
사로잡힌 난 네 먹잇감
움직일수록 더 좁아지는 행동반경
최고의 반전 겉모습은 함정
poison 장전 주입해
더 빨리 빠르게 돌아 몸에 독을 가둬

발맞춰 살아가지만 삐걱대
애써 나를 위해 외치는 듯해
break a leg
in my zone 도심 속 잘 맞춰
사람도 만나지만
교통정리가 안 된 차들처럼
이리 치이고 저리 치이곤 해
난 왜 없는데 어디 가면 있는데
게임마저 잘 보면 안전지대가 있던데
그래 의미 없이 발만 구르지
이건 마치 깡통 porsche
나도 가고 싶은데 where is that mindset
내 심리 속에서도 있기는 한 걸까
그 누군가는 나에게 아낌없이 줬을 터인데
잠시 돌이켜보기 위한 내 그루터기는 어딨나
어둠 속 안도의 한줄기 빛은 어디일까
고즈넉한 home 아니면 저 먼 blue일까

믿어주는 사람들의 응원
그들도 등을 돌리면 차갑고
날 이끈 people
잘 생각해 보면 두려워
피를 나눈 사람도
털어놓을 순 없는 사명감
요즘은 사람보다 동물이 좋더라
but 느껴 자멸감
임종을 앞둔 노을 같아
shine goes dark
밤과 새벽을 달래줄 light
right for mine
wheres that zone
큰 재해도 피해 가는
나의 green zonе
but 이 길을 선택하는 순간
있기는 할까 나의 safe zone
어둠 속 안도의 한줄기 빛은 어디일까

이름은 jung kook 스케일은 전국
학교 대신 연습실에서 밤새
춤을 추고 노래 불렀네
너희가 놀 때 난 꿈을
집도하며 잠을 참아가며
매일 밤새 볼펜을 잡네
아침 해가 뜬 뒤에 나 눈을 감네
이중잣대와 수많은 반대 속에서
깨부숴버린 나의 한계
그에 반해 재수 좋게 회사에 컨택된 속칭
노래 못 해 랩퍼를 당한
너희에게 랩퍼라는 타이틀은 사치

이 사랑은 악마의 또 다른 이름
손을 잡지 마
외쳤지만 저버렸지 내 양심을

깨어나고 볼 땐 이미 사방엔 지뢰
건드릴 수 없는 매서운 주위의 시선들
기적을 외쳐 이 현실에

if its me thinking too much
if its me worrying too much
could you perhaps grant me a cuddle
theres a kind of feeling i cant voice a kind of feeling i cant voice
always cant seem to voice it always cant seem to voice it
its like a piece is missing from my heart
but i cant seem to feel much sorrow for it
even if its bitter i cant spit it out
even when i want to cry the tears wont come out

holding out hoping that you feel the same

your leap of faith made me
put all my faith in you
so all i do is think about
no regrets not even the nights wе spent
finding out what patience mеant
holding up a mirror to myself
learning to reflect
because love like this doesnt come round all the time
and letting you get away would be a crime
cause half of your heart makes a whole lot of this heart of mine

salt air and the rust on your door
i never needed anything more
whispers of are you sure
never have i ever before
but i can see us lost in the memory
august slipped away into a moment in time
cause it was never mine
and i can see us twisted in bedsheets
august sipped away like a bottle of wine
cause you were never mine
your back beneath the sun
wishin i could write my name on it
will you call when youre back at school
i remember thinkin i had you
but i can see us lost in the memory
august slipped away into a moment in time
cause it was never mine
and i can see us twisted in bedsheets
august sipped away like a bottle of wine
cause you were never mine
back when we were still changin for the better
wanting was enough
for me it was enough
to live for the hope of it all
cancel plans just in case youd call
and say meet me behind the mall
so much for summer love and saying us
cause you werent mine to lose
you werent mine to lose no
but i can see us lost in the memory
august slipped away into a moment in time
cause it was never mine
and i can see us twisted in bedsheets
august sipped away like a bottle of wine
cause you were never mine
cause you were never mine
never mine
but do you remember
remember when i pulled up and said get in the car
and then canceled my plans just in case youd call
back when i was livin for the hope of it all for the hope of it all
meet me behind the mall

i hear the clock tick and think of you
caught up in circles
confusion is nothing new
flashback warm nights
almost left behind
suitcase of memories
time after
sometimes you picture me
im walking too far ahead
youre calling to me
i cant hear what youve said
then you say go slow
i fall behind
the second hand unwinds
if youre lost you can look and you will find me
time after time
if you fall i will catch you ill be waiting
time after time
if youre lost you can look and you will find me
time after time
if you fall i will catch you ill be waiting i will be waiting

after my picture fades
and darkness has turned to gray
watching through windows
youre wondering if im okay
secrets stolen from deep inside
the drum beats out of time
if youre lost you can look and you will find me

if you fall i will catch you ill be waiting

thats what happens when you fall in love
you dont have the time you leave them all behind
you tell yourself its fine youre just in love
dont know where you are right now
did you see me on tv
ill try not to starve myself
just because youre mad at me
and ill be in denial for at least a little while
what about the plans we made

while theyre overturning roe v wade

на одно лицо
я хочу залезть
с головой в песок
злоба дня развяжет руки
если не умру со скуки
я как волк в овечьей шкуре
стойко перенесший бурю
да это то что называется мечта
и я не готов отказаться от себя
но мне не важно я совсем не чистоплюй
может быть на мне иудин поцелуй
алкоголь  мой друг
алкоголь  мой враг
алкоголь всегда
в чемто виноват
посреди дворцов
на одно лицо
я хочу залезть
с головой в песок
алкоголь  мой друг
только это только между нами
ничего не будет между нами
алкоголь  мой враг
алкоголь  мой друг
алкоголь  мой враг
алкоголь всегда
в чемто виноват
посреди дворцов
на одно лицо
я хочу залезть
с головой в песок"

samolot miękko zejdzie w dół
i miasto jak muzyczny super  sam
zbudzi sześć śpiących strun
taksówką żółtą tak jak china town
ruszymy tłumiąc pożar serc
w muzykę która nie zna prawd i kłamstw
ale jest ciągle jest
nie wszyscy wielcy już przestali grać
choć powiał wiatr pogodą dla bogaczy
złe czarne fortepiany nie chcą spać
żyje w nich stary blues
na tin pan alley w sklepach dobre dni
ulicznym grajkom znów się tutaj płaci
głośniki dudnią przez otwarte drzwi
szybciej im bije puls
nie wszyscy wielcy już przestali grać
choć powiał wiatr pogodą dla bogaczy
złe czarne fortepiany nie chcą spać
żyje w nich stary blues
w witrynach nuty z pięćdziesiątych lat
okładki lekko zdartych płyt
muzyka którą zawsze kochał świat
dobrych firm
znany szyld
co z tego weźmiesz to już twoja rzecz
taksówka wróci z piskiem kół
i znów lotnisko lot 55
jeszcze raz
patrzysz w dół
nie wszyscy wielcy już przestali grać
choć powiał wiatr pogodą dla bogaczy
złe czarne fortepiany nie chcą spać
żyje w nich stary blues
na tin pan alley w sklepach dobre dni
ulicznym grajkom znów się tutaj płaci
głośniki dudnią przez otwarte drzwi
szybciej im bije puls
nie wszyscy wielcy już przestali grać
choć powiał wiatr pogodą dla bogaczy
złe czarne fortepiany nie chcą spać
żyje w nich stary blues
nie wszyscy wielcy już przestali grać
choć powiał wiatr pogodą dla bogaczy
złe czarne fortepiany nie chcą spać
żyje w nich stary blues"

кажется что бьётся сердце
ночь меня избавит от моих оков кандалов
как атлант расправил плечи
просыпается вся нечисть
улицы города во власти мертвецов
на меня красиво падал лунный свет лунный свет
рассыпался над домами фейерверк фейерверк
я не отражался в окнах  в чём секрет в чём секрет
солнце село  я уже не человек человек
мне рассвет подрезал крылья
было явью стало пылью
только губы помнят этот сладкий вкус сладкий вкус
ото всех скрывают стены
у меня нет даже тени
как всегда сгинет день и я опять вернусь
во сколько сегодня закат
я чую пора убивать
если отходишь ко сну
я в твою дверь постучу
на меня красиво падал лунный свет лунный свет
рассыпался над домами фейерверк фейерверк
я не отражался в окнах  в чём секрет в чём секрет
солнце село  я уже не человек человек
о фейерверк
о фейерверк
о фейерверк
о фейерверк
на тебя красиво падал лунный свет лунный свет
а в глазах не отражался фейерверк фейерверк
на твоих ресницах таял красный снег красный снег
и на них красиво падал лунный свет лунный свет
лунный свет лунный свет красный снег
лунный свет лунный свет лунный свет"
