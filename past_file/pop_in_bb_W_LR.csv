she said dont you worry if i disappear
i told her im not really looking for another mistake
i called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
but then i jumped right in a week later returned
i reckon she was only lookin for a lover to burn
but i gave her my time for two or three nights
then i put it on pause until the moment was right
i went away for months until our paths crossed again
she told me i was never looking for a friend
maybe you could swing by my room around 10
baby bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
well be in between the sheets till the late am
baby if you wanted me then you should have just said shes singin
dont  with my love
that heart is so cold
all over my home
i dont wanna know that babe
dont  with my love
i told her she knows
take aim and reload
i dont wanna know that babe
and for a couple weeks i only wanna see her
we drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
before a text message was the only way to reach her
now shes stayin at my place and loves the way i treat her
singing out aretha all over the track like a feature
and never wants to sleep i guess that i dont want to either
but me and her we make money the same way
four cities two planes the same day
and those shows have never been what its about
but maybe well go together and just figure it out
id rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
but we should get on a plane or well be missin it now
wish id have written it down the way that things played out
when she was kissin him how i was confused about
now she should figure it out while im sat here singing
dont  with my love
that heart is so cold
all over my home
i dont wanna know that babe
dont  with my love
i told her she knows
take aim and reload
i dont wanna know that babe
on my hotel door
i dont even know if she knows what for
she was cryin on my shoulder i already told ya
trust and respect is what we do this for
i never intended to be next get lost
but you didnt need to take him to bed thats all
and i never saw him as a threat get lost
until you disappeared with him to have sex of course
its not like we were both on tour
we were stayin on the same  hotel floor
and i wasnt lookin for a promise or commitment
but it was never just fun and i thought you were different
this is not the way you realised what you wanted
its a bit too much too late if im honest
and all this time god knows im singin
dont  with my love
that heart is so cold
all over my home
i dont wanna know that babe
dont  with my love
i told her she knows

and the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
until then weve got nothin to say and nothin to know
but somethin to drink and maybe somethin to smoke
let it go until our roads are changed
singin we found love in a local rave
no i dont really know what im supposed to say
but i can just figure it out and then just hope and pray
i told her my name and said its nice to meet ya
then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
i already know shes a keeper just from this one small act of kindness
im in deep  if anybody finds out
i meant to drive home but ive drunk all of it now
not soberin up we just sit on the couch
one thing led to another now shes kissin my mouth

i want the world in my hands
i hate the beach but i stand
in california with my toes in the sand
use the sleeves of my sweater lets have an adventure
head in the clouds but my gravitys centered
touch my neck and ill touch yours
you in those little highwaisted shorts oh
she knows what i think about
and what i think about
one love two mouths
one love one house
no shirt no blouse
just us you find out
nothing that i wouldnt wanna tell you about no
cause its too cold for you here and now
so let me hold both your hands in the holes of my sweater
and if i may just take your breath away
i dont mind if theres not much to say
sometimes the silence guides a mind
to move to a place so far away
the goosebumps start to raise
the minute that my left hand meets your waist
and then i watch your face
put my finger on your tongue cause you love the taste yeah
these hearts adore
everyone the other beats hardest for
inside this place is warm
outside it starts to pour
comin down
one love two mouths
one love one house
no shirt no blouse
just us you find out
nothin that i wouldnt wanna tell you about
no no no
cause its too cold for you here and now
so let me hold both your hands in the holes of my sweater
cause its too cold for you here and now
so let me hold both your hands in the holes of my sweater

i thought about our last kiss how it felt the way you tasted
and even though your friends tell me youre doin fine
are you somewhere feeling lonely even though hes right beside you
when he says those words that hurt you do you read the ones i wrote you
sometimes i start to wonder was it just a lie
if what we had was real how could you be fine
cause im not fine at all
i remember the day you told me you were leavin
i remember the makeup running down your face
and the dreams you left behind you didnt need them
like every single wish we ever made
i wish that i could wake up with amnesia
and forget about the stupid little things
like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
and the memories i never can escape
cause im not fine at all
the pictures that you sent me theyre still livin in my phone
ill admit i like to see them ill admit i feel alone
and all my friends keep asking why im not around
it hurts to know youre happy yeah it hurts that you moved on
its hard to hear your name when i havent seen you in so long
its like we never happened was it just a lie

and ive not seen the roaring fields in so long i know ive grown

had my first kiss on a friday night i dont reckon that i did it right

i never went boatin dont get how they are floatin
and sometimes i get so scared of what i cant understand
but here i am next to you
the skys more blue in malibu
next to you in malibu
next to you baby
we watched the sun go down as we were walkin
id spend the rest of my life just standing here talkin
you would explain the current as i just smile
hoping that youll stay the same and nothing will change
and itll be us just for a while do they even exist
thats when i make a wish to swim away with the fish
cause its supposed to be this hot all summer long
i never wouldve believed you if three years ago you told me

running scared i was there

so casually cruel in the name of being honest

after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
