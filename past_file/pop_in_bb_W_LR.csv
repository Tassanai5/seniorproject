she said dont you worry if i disappear
i told her im not really looking for another mistake
i called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
but then i jumped right in a week later returned
i reckon she was only lookin for a lover to burn
but i gave her my time for two or three nights
then i put it on pause until the moment was right
i went away for months until our paths crossed again
she told me i was never looking for a friend
maybe you could swing by my room around 10
baby bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
well be in between the sheets till the late am
baby if you wanted me then you should have just said shes singin
dont  with my love
that heart is so cold
all over my home
i dont wanna know that babe
dont  with my love
i told her she knows
take aim and reload
i dont wanna know that babe
and for a couple weeks i only wanna see her
we drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
before a text message was the only way to reach her
now shes stayin at my place and loves the way i treat her
singing out aretha all over the track like a feature
and never wants to sleep i guess that i dont want to either
but me and her we make money the same way
four cities two planes the same day
and those shows have never been what its about
but maybe well go together and just figure it out
id rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
but we should get on a plane or well be missin it now
wish id have written it down the way that things played out
when she was kissin him how i was confused about
now she should figure it out while im sat here singing
dont  with my love
that heart is so cold
all over my home
i dont wanna know that babe
dont  with my love
i told her she knows
take aim and reload
i dont wanna know that babe
on my hotel door
i dont even know if she knows what for
she was cryin on my shoulder i already told ya
trust and respect is what we do this for
i never intended to be next get lost
but you didnt need to take him to bed thats all
and i never saw him as a threat get lost
until you disappeared with him to have sex of course
its not like we were both on tour
we were stayin on the same  hotel floor
and i wasnt lookin for a promise or commitment
but it was never just fun and i thought you were different
this is not the way you realised what you wanted
its a bit too much too late if im honest
and all this time god knows im singin
dont  with my love
that heart is so cold

i dont wanna know that babe

and the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
until then weve got nothin to say and nothin to know
but somethin to drink and maybe somethin to smoke
let it go until our roads are changed
singin we found love in a local rave
no i dont really know what im supposed to say
but i can just figure it out and then just hope and pray
i told her my name and said its nice to meet ya
then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
i already know shes a keeper just from this one small act of kindness
im in deep  if anybody finds out
i meant to drive home but ive drunk all of it now
not soberin up we just sit on the couch
one thing led to another now shes kissin my mouth

the pictures that you sent me theyre still livin in my phone
ill admit i like to see them ill admit i feel alone

hoping that youll stay the same and nothing will change
and itll be us just for a while do they even exist

you can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
like resignation to the end always the end
so when we found that we could not make sense
well you said that we would still be friends
but ill admit that i was glad it was over
but you didnt have to cut me off
make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
and i dont even need your love
but you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
no you didnt have to stoop so low
have your friends collect your records and then change your number
i guess that i dont need that though
now youre just somebody that i used to know
now youre just somebody that i used to know
now youre just somebody that i used to know
now and then i think of all the times you screwed me over
but had me believing it was always something that id done

you said that you could let it go
